# Open Design Plugin & Marketplace — Implementation Plan (living)

Source spec: [`docs/plugins-spec.md`](../plugins-spec.md) (zh-CN: [`docs/plugins-spec.zh-CN.md`](../plugins-spec.zh-CN.md)).

Sibling docs: [`spec.md`](../spec.md) · [`skills-protocol.md`](../skills-protocol.md) · [`architecture.md`](../architecture.md).

Update protocol — read first

- This file is a **living roadmap**. Every PR that lands a chunk of the plugin system must flip the matching `[ ]` to `[x]` in the same PR, and update §3 "Architecture state" if a new module / table / endpoint becomes real.
- Do not edit `docs/plugins-spec.md` from this file's PRs except to fix factual drift; the spec is the contract, this file is the schedule.
- The "Definition of done" gates in §8 are the **only** hard sign-off bar; an empty checkbox under a phase does not mean v1 is broken — only an empty checkbox under §8 does.
- When `docs/plugins-spec.md` patches change phase numbering or atom names, mirror those changes here in the same PR (per §21.6 / §22.5 / §23.6 of the spec).

## 1. Invariants (lock these first; never violate without a spec patch)

These are the five rules that decide every downstream design decision. They sit above phases and are checked by reviewers on every plugin-related PR.

- [x] **I1. `SKILL.md` is the floor; `open-design.json` is a sidecar; never bidirectionally couple.** `packages/plugin-runtime/adapters/agent-skill.ts` synthesizes a schema-valid `PluginManifest` from `SKILL.md` `od:` frontmatter (verified via `packages/plugin-runtime/tests/adapter-agent-skill.test.ts`). The bundled e2e fixture under `apps/daemon/tests/fixtures/plugin-fixtures/sample-plugin/` ships both halves and `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-e2e-fixture.test.ts` exercises the merger.
- [x] **I2. Apply is a pure function; side effects only after `POST /api/projects` / `POST /api/runs`.** `apps/daemon/src/plugins/apply.ts` is FS- and DB-free; the snapshot writer (`snapshots.ts`) and installer are the only modules that mutate persistent state. `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-apply.test.ts` asserts deterministic snapshots from the same inputs and refuses to touch the registry / FS.
- [x] **I3. `AppliedPluginSnapshot` is the only contract between "plugin" and "run".** `composeSystemPrompt()` now accepts a `pluginBlock` derived from the snapshot via `pluginPromptBlock(snapshot)` (`apps/daemon/src/plugins/apply.ts`); the run reads context through the snapshot. Plugin runs in web API-fallback mode are rejected at the HTTP layer (Phase 2A wires the 409); the snapshot table is the only writable surface for the contract.
- [ ] **I4. CLI is the canonical agent-facing API; UI mirrors CLI, not the other way round.** Phase 1: `od plugin install/list/info/uninstall/apply/doctor` and the matching `/api/plugins/*` HTTP routes ship in the same PR. Remaining `od project/run/files/conversation/marketplace` subcommands roll in over Phase 1 / 2C / 3 PRs.
- [x] **I5. Kernel/userspace boundary (spec §23) is drawn from day 1.** `composeSystemPrompt()` is structured as a pure assembler with a content table (DESIGN.md, craft, skill, plugin block, metadata); the new `pluginBlock` parameter slots in without restructuring. Phase 2A lifts the renderer into `packages/contracts/src/prompts/plugin-block.ts` (PB1).

CI guard placement: each invariant must have at least one automated test that fails when the rule is violated. The test path is recorded next to the box when it lands.

Hard layering rules

- `packages/plugin-runtime` does not import `node:fs`. It receives `loader: (relpath) => Promise<string>`. Daemon injects real FS, CI injects mocks, web preview sandbox injects fetch.
- `apps/daemon/src/plugins/snapshots.ts` is the only file that issues `INSERT/UPDATE` against `applied_plugin_snapshots`. CI guard: `rg "applied_plugin_snapshots" --type ts -g '!**/*.test.ts'` may match `INSERT` only inside `snapshots.ts`.
- `connector-gate.ts` is a stateless validator (`(snapshotId, connectorId) => allow | deny`); `tool-tokens.ts` calls it before issuing a token, and `/api/tools/connectors/execute` re-validates on every call to defeat token replacement.

## 3. Architecture state (update as modules land)

This section tracks **what exists in the repo today**. Update in the same PR that lands the module; never let it lie about reality.

### 3.0 Current architecture clarifications (2026-05-13)

These notes capture the product/implementation answers that otherwise get lost between the spec and the code:

- **No plugin selected does not mean a naked agent.** `composeSystemPrompt()` still always layers the Open Design base designer/discovery prompt, project metadata, active design system/craft, and daemon-owned safety/tooling guidance. Plugin context is additive: a selected plugin contributes snapshot-derived `## Active plugin`, `## Plugin inputs`, and active-stage atom blocks. Home free-form runs route through the bundled hidden `od-default` scenario, which shapes task type and then returns to the normal design pipeline.
- **The pipeline is plugin-assembled, not a fixed wizard.** The reference shorthand is `discovery -> plan -> generate -> critique`, but the runnable shape comes from `od.pipeline.stages[].atoms[]` on the applied plugin or bundled scenario fallback. `apps/daemon/src/plugins/pipeline-runner.ts` emits stage/GenUI events and `packages/contracts/src/prompts/atom-block.ts` renders the active stage body. Some atoms are still prompt fragments / permissive workers; observable atoms such as `diff-review`, `build-test`, and `handoff` now emit durable files or signals.
- **GenUI is controlled rendering.** Agents/plugins emit structured surface requests (`form`, `choice`, `confirmation`, `oauth-prompt`) and OD renders them with product-owned React/CLI components. Inline `<question-form>` chat UI follows the same principle: parse structured data, render through `QuestionForm`, and keep styling in OD. Plugin-bundled custom components are a separate sandboxed path behind `genui:custom-component`.
- **AG-UI is interoperability, not the product UI runtime.** `packages/agui-adapter` and `GET /api/runs/:runId/agui` are shipped so CopilotKit / AG-UI clients can consume an OD run. The internal web/desktop UI remains OD-native; adding CopilotKit itself is only justified for an explicit external embed/demo/client.
- **Scenario discovery still has one product gap.** `apps/web/src/components/home-hero/chips.ts` is a curated Home rail for high-frequency scenarios. `apps/web/src/components/plugins-home/facets.ts` is more data-driven and derives category/subcategory facets from plugin metadata. The desired next slice is a single scenario registry / manifest projection that feeds Home chips, plugin filters, composer tools, and `@search`.

Three reads from the graph (drove the §6 phase reorder)

- `snapshots.ts` is the keystone. It must land in Phase 1 week 1, before pipeline / genui / connector-gate.
- `pipeline.ts` and `genui/*` are co-required for the first marketable plugin (`make-a-deck` needs `direction-picker` + `oauth-prompt`); they must land in the same phase.
- CLI and Web parallelize cleanly once `ApplyResult` JSON is stable; the only sync point is the ND-JSON event schema in `packages/contracts/src/plugins/events.ts`.

---

## 5. Foundations (early bedrock — invest in Phase 0–1 to avoid Phase 3+ rework)

- [x] **F1. Freeze `manifestSourceDigest` algorithm in Phase 0.** Implementation in `packages/plugin-runtime/src/digest.ts`; input `{manifest, inputs, resolvedContextRefs}` → sha256 hex. `packages/plugin-runtime/tests/digest.test.ts` pins 2 known-good digests + canonical-key-order invariant; daemon upgrades cannot change them.
- [x] **F2. Define `PersistedAgentEvent` plugin variants in Phase 1, even if they fire later.** Variants live in `packages/contracts/src/plugins/events.ts` (`pipeline_stage_*`, `genui_surface_*`); pipeline / genui emitters land Phase 2A.
- [x] **F3. `installed_plugins.source_kind` accepts `'bundled'` from Phase 1.** `PluginSourceKindSchema` permissive: `bundled / user / project / marketplace / github / url / local`.
- [x] **F4. `PluginAssetRef.stageAt` defaults to `'run-start'`, never `'project-create'`.** Default baked into `packages/contracts/src/plugins/apply.ts`.
- [ ] **F5. `--json` output uses contracts types; no inline reshape in `cli.ts`.** Phase 1 CLI ships `--json` for `list/info/apply/doctor` returning the daemon JSON verbatim; the next CLI rev imports `ApplyResult` etc. from contracts to satisfy the compile-time guarantee.
- [x] **F6. `OD_MAX_DEVLOOP_ITERATIONS` lives in `apps/daemon/src/app-config.ts`, default 10, override via env.** Read via `readPluginEnvKnobs()`; consumed by Phase 2A `pipeline.ts`.
- [ ] **F7. `od plugin doctor` validates `od.connectors.required[]` against `connectorService.listAll()` from Phase 1.** Phase 1 doctor validates manifest schema, atoms, and resolved skill / DS / craft refs; the connector lookup wires in once `connectorService` is exposed to the doctor module (Phase 1 cleanup PR).
- [x] **F8. Cross-conversation cache (`genui_surfaces` lookup) goes live with the table — i.e. Phase 2A — and a daemon test asserts the second `oauth-prompt` does not broadcast.** Covered by `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-pipeline-runner.test.ts` (`reuses a project-tier surface answer across conversations`).
- [x] **F9. Snapshot lifecycle env vars (PB2)** live in `apps/daemon/src/app-config.ts` from Phase 1: `OD_SNAPSHOT_UNREFERENCED_TTL_DAYS` (default `30`, set to `0` to disable), `OD_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default unset, opt-in), `OD_SNAPSHOT_GC_INTERVAL_MS` (default `6 * 60 * 60 * 1000`). All three live in `readPluginEnvKnobs()`; `applied_plugin_snapshots.expires_at` is stamped on insert; the GC worker lands Phase 5.

---

## 6. Phase plan (re-ordered from spec §16 by dependency, not by user-visible feature)

The spec §16 ordering is reader-facing; this is the build order. Each phase has explicit deliverables, validation steps, and an exit criterion. Flip checkboxes in PRs that land each item.

### Phase 0 — Spec freeze + contracts skeleton (1–2 d)

Deliverables

- [x] `docs/schemas/open-design.plugin.v1.json` — JSON Schema v1.
- [x] `docs/schemas/open-design.marketplace.v1.json` — JSON Schema v1.
- [x] `packages/contracts/src/plugins/{manifest,context,apply,marketplace,installed,events}.ts` (types + Zod schemas; no logic).
- [x] Re-export from `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`.
- [x] `packages/plugin-runtime/src/digest.ts` with frozen sha256 algorithm + fixture cases (`packages/plugin-runtime/tests/digest.test.ts`).

Validation

- [x] `pnpm --filter @open-design/plugin-runtime test`
- [x] `pnpm guard && pnpm typecheck`
- [x] CI digest stability: re-running `digest()` on the fixtures matches the pinned hex.

Exit criterion

- Importing `import type { ApplyResult, AppliedPluginSnapshot } from '@open-design/contracts'` works from daemon and web. ✓ verified.

### Phase 1 — Loader + installer + apply + snapshot + headless CLI loop (5–7 d)

Why merged with the spec's "headless MVP CLI loop" — see I4. The spec's Phase 1 explicitly pulls this forward; this plan keeps that.

Deliverables (week 1: data layer)

- [x] SQLite migration for `installed_plugins`, `plugin_marketplaces`, `applied_plugin_snapshots` (including `expires_at INTEGER` per PB2). The `runs` table is in-memory in `apps/daemon/src/runs.ts`; the in-memory run carries the snapshot id today. `projects` and `conversations` get `applied_plugin_snapshot_id` ALTERs in `migratePlugins()`.
- [x] `apps/daemon/src/app-config.ts` defines `OD_SNAPSHOT_UNREFERENCED_TTL_DAYS` (default `30`), `OD_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default unset), `OD_SNAPSHOT_GC_INTERVAL_MS`, and `OD_MAX_DEVLOOP_ITERATIONS` (F6) under `readPluginEnvKnobs()`. Apply path stamps `expires_at` on insert; GC worker lands Phase 5.
- [x] `packages/plugin-runtime` parsers / adapters / merger / resolver / validator + digest.
- [x] `apps/daemon/src/plugins/registry.ts` — install-root scan, sidecar + adapter merge, SQLite reader/writer. (Hot reload + project tier scan land Phase 2A.)
- [x] `apps/daemon/src/plugins/installer.ts` — local folder install with path-traversal guard, 50 MiB size cap, symlink rejection. GitHub tarball / HTTPS sources land Phase 2A.
- [x] `apps/daemon/src/plugins/apply.ts` — pure; emits `ApplyResult` with draft snapshot.
- [x] `apps/daemon/src/plugins/snapshots.ts` — sole writer of `applied_plugin_snapshots`. (Repo-level `rg` guard wiring in `scripts/guard.ts` lands in the Phase 2A polish PR.)
- [ ] Refactor `apps/daemon/src/{skills,design-systems,craft}.ts` to delegate to `registry.ts`. Phase 1 keeps the existing loaders independent so `/api/skills`, `/api/design-systems`, `/api/craft` endpoints remain byte-for-byte stable; Phase 2A folds them into the plugin registry.

Deliverables (week 2: surface layer)

- [x] HTTP: `GET /api/plugins`, `GET /api/plugins/:id`, `POST /api/plugins/install` (SSE), `POST /api/plugins/:id/uninstall`, `POST /api/plugins/:id/apply`, `POST /api/plugins/:id/doctor`, `GET /api/atoms`, `GET /api/applied-plugins/:snapshotId`. `POST /api/projects` / `POST /api/runs` continue to accept their existing payloads; the explicit `pluginId` / `appliedPluginSnapshotId` plumbing lands as a follow-up Phase 1 PR once the `runs` SQL migration is in place.
- [x] `composeSystemPrompt()` in `apps/daemon/src/prompts/system.ts` accepts a `pluginBlock` rendered from the snapshot via `pluginPromptBlock(snapshot)` and emits `## Active plugin` + `## Plugin inputs` sections. Shape: pure assembler + content table (per I5).
- [x] CLI: `od plugin install/list/info/uninstall/apply/doctor`. `od project / run / files` subcommands stay scheduled for the Phase 1 follow-up PR.
- [ ] Phase 1 `od plugin doctor` covers: schema validation, SKILL.md parse, atom id existence check, resolved-context ref check, digest drift detection. MCP dry-launch and connector existence (F7) land in the Phase 1 cleanup PR.

Validation

- [x] `pnpm --filter @open-design/plugin-runtime test` covers: digest stability, `parseManifest` + `parseMarketplace`, SKILL frontmatter adapter, sidecar+adapter merge precedence, `validateSafe` cross-field rules.
- [x] `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-{apply,snapshots,installer,e2e-fixture}.test.ts` cover apply purity, snapshot writer, installer guards, and the closed-loop install→apply→snapshot→doctor walk.
- [x] **e2e-1 closed loop** — `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-e2e-fixture.test.ts` runs the §12.5 walk against the bundled `apps/daemon/tests/fixtures/plugin-fixtures/sample-plugin/` fixture without spinning the HTTP server.
- [ ] **e2e-2 pure apply across runs** — Phase 1 follow-up: drive `applyPlugin` through `POST /api/plugins/:id/apply` against a running daemon and assert two consecutive applies share the same `manifestSourceDigest`.
- [ ] **e2e-3 headless run** — needs `od daemon start --headless` (Phase 1.5) and the `od run start --plugin <id>` plumbing (Phase 1 follow-up).

Exit criterion

- Phase 1 daemon-only walkthrough is green: `od plugin install --source <fixture>` → `od plugin list` → `od plugin apply <id>` produces a stable `AppliedPluginSnapshot`. The §12.5 web-driven walkthrough requires the Phase 1 follow-up PR + Phase 1.5 headless flag.

### Phase 1.5 — Headless daemon lifecycle subset (1 d)

Pulled out of spec §16 Phase 5 because Phase 1 e2e needs it. Avoids "Phase 1 looks green on macOS desktop, breaks on Linux CI" false positives.

Deliverables

- [x] `od daemon start --headless` flag (no electron, no web bundle).
- [x] `od daemon start --serve-web` flag (web UI without electron). Today this is an alias of `--headless` because the v1 daemon serves both API and web UI from the same Express app; the flag is reserved so packaged callers can branch on it.
- [x] Honor `OD_BIND_HOST` and `OD_PORT` in headless mode (the flags forward into the env so the existing daemon code path picks them up unchanged).
- [x] `od daemon stop`, `od daemon status --json`.

Validation

- [x] `apps/daemon/tests/daemon-lifecycle.test.ts` covers the `/api/daemon/status` shape and the loopback-only enforcement on `/api/daemon/shutdown`.
- [ ] `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-headless-run.test.ts` covers e2e-3's HTTP-level walkthrough; the full Docker re-run is deferred to the Phase 5 cloud-deployment PR.

### Phase 2A — Pipeline + devloop + GenUI(confirmation/oauth-prompt) + connector-gate + Web inline rail (4–6 d)

Deliverables (daemon)

- [x] `apps/daemon/src/plugins/pipeline.ts` — stage scheduler; `until` evaluator; devloop with `OD_MAX_DEVLOOP_ITERATIONS` ceiling.
- [x] `apps/daemon/src/plugins/pipeline-runner.ts` — bridges the scheduler onto a live run's SSE stream + GenUI cache.
- [x] SQLite migration: `run_devloop_iterations`, `genui_surfaces` (3 indexes), `connectors_required_json` / `connectors_resolved_json` / `mcp_servers_json` columns on `applied_plugin_snapshots`.
- [x] `apps/daemon/src/genui/{registry,events,store}.ts` — confirmation, oauth-prompt, form, choice surfaces; reuse the existing `apps/daemon/src/connectors/` flow for `oauth.route='connector'`.
- [x] Cross-conversation cache (F8) — `lookupResolved` + emit `genui_surface_response { respondedBy: 'cache' }`.
- [x] `apps/daemon/src/plugins/connector-gate.ts` — apply path connector resolution + token-issuance gate. `/api/tools/connectors/execute` re-validates per call (`CONNECTOR_NOT_GRANTED`).
- [x] HTTP: `GET /api/runs/:runId/genui`, `GET /api/projects/:projectId/genui`, `POST /api/runs/:runId/genui/:surfaceId/respond`, `POST /api/projects/:projectId/genui/:surfaceId/revoke`, `POST /api/projects/:projectId/genui/prefill`, `POST /api/runs/:runId/replay`, `GET /api/runs/:runId/devloop-iterations`.
- [x] SSE / ND-JSON streams emit `pipeline_stage_started/completed`, `genui_surface_request/response/timeout`, `genui_state_synced` per F2.
- [x] API-fallback rejection: `/api/proxy/*` returns `409 PLUGIN_REQUIRES_DAEMON` (e2e-7).
- [x] **PB1 — `renderPluginBlock(snapshot)` lives in `packages/contracts/src/prompts/plugin-block.ts`.** Both composers import it; v1 fallback still 409s.

Deliverables (CLI)

- [x] `od plugin trust <id> --capabilities …` (with `connector:<id>` form) + `--revoke`.
- [x] `od plugin apply --grant-caps a,b` + `--input k=v` (repeated).
- [x] `od plugin replay <runId>`.
- [x] `od ui list/show/respond/revoke/prefill`.
- [x] CLI structured error envelope for §12.4 exit codes (64–73).
- [x] `od plugin run <id>` apply→start shorthand (full ND-JSON streaming via `od run watch` lands as part of the Phase 1 follow-up).
- [x] `od plugin snapshots list / prune` (operator escape hatch).

Deliverables (web)

- [x] `applyPlugin(pluginId, projectId?)` helper in `apps/web/src/state/projects.ts`.
- [x] `InlinePluginsRail`, `ContextChipStrip`, `PluginInputsForm`.
- [x] `GenUISurfaceRenderer` for `confirmation` + `oauth-prompt` (cards / modal); `form` / `choice` ship a fallback JSON-Schema preview + textarea until Phase 2A.5.
- [x] `GenUIInbox` drawer.
- [x] Mount the trio in `NewProjectPanel` and `ChatComposer` — `PluginsSection` wraps `InlinePluginsRail`/`ContextChipStrip`/`PluginInputsForm` and is mounted under the project-name input in `NewProjectPanel.tsx:467` and above the composer input in `ChatComposer.tsx:701` (variant='strip').

Validation

- [x] **e2e-4 replay invariance** — `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-dod-e2e.test.ts`.
- [x] **e2e-5 GenUI cross-conversation** — `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-pipeline-runner.test.ts`.
- [x] **e2e-6 connector gate** — `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-dod-e2e.test.ts` + `plugins-tool-token-gate.test.ts`.
- [x] **e2e-7 api-fallback rejection** — `apps/daemon/tests/proxy-routes.test.ts`.
- [x] Daemon unit test: pipeline stage scheduler converges on a critique signal in ≤3 iterations — `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-pipeline-runner.test.ts`.
- [x] Daemon unit test: F8 cache hit does not broadcast — `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-pipeline-runner.test.ts`.

### Phase 2A.5 — GenUI form + choice + JSON Schema renderer (2–3 d)

Deliverables

- [x] `GenUISurfaceRenderer` extended for `form` and `choice`; JSON Schema → React form bridge (small, in-tree; no external dep added). Strict subset: `type:object` properties whose leaves are scalars (`string` / `number` / `integer` / `boolean`) or single-level enums; nested objects/arrays fall back to the JSON textarea. `defaultValue` is honoured so cross-conversation re-asks pre-fill. (`apps/web/src/components/GenUISurfaceRenderer.tsx` `JsonSchemaFormSurface` + `readObjectSchemaFields`).
- [x] CLI parity: `GET /api/runs/:runId/genui/:surfaceId` enriches the response with the snapshot's surface spec (incl. JSON Schema). `od ui show --schema` prints just the schema for headless agents (`apps/daemon/src/cli.ts:UI_BOOLEAN_FLAGS` + the `--schema` shortcut in `runUiShow`).

Validation

- [x] Web test: `apps/web/tests/components/GenUISurfaceRenderer.schema-form.test.tsx` covers the structured form path (string + select + integer + boolean), default-value seeding, single-enum choice routing through the existing button-group renderer, and the JSON-textarea fallback for unsupported leaves.
- [x] Daemon test: `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-genui-spec-enrichment.test.ts` boots the daemon, installs a fixture plugin with a form surface, creates a project + snapshot, drops a `genui_surfaces` row, and asserts the `GET /api/runs/:runId/genui/:surfaceId` response carries `spec.schema` exactly as declared in the manifest.
- [ ] Daemon test (deferred): a `form` surface answered via `od ui respond --value-json '...'` and a UI answer both emit `genui_surface_response` with `respondedBy: 'user'` — kept open for the dedicated CLI ↔ UI parity sweep in Phase 4 e2e-9.

### Phase 2B — Marketplace deep UI + ChatComposer apply + preview sandbox (4–6 d)

Deliverables

- [x] Routes `/marketplace`, `/marketplace/:id` (alias `/plugins/:id`) in `apps/web/src/router.ts:33`.
- [x] `MarketplaceView`, `PluginDetailView` (`apps/web/src/components/MarketplaceView.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/PluginDetailView.tsx`).
- [x] `ChatComposer` integrates `PluginsSection` (which composes `InlinePluginsRail` + `ContextChipStrip` + `PluginInputsForm`) at `ChatComposer.tsx:701`; `applyPlugin()` accepts the bound `projectId` (`apps/web/src/state/projects.ts`).
- [x] `GET /api/plugins/:id/preview` and `/api/plugins/:id/example/:name` with the §9.2 sandbox CSP (`default-src 'none'; connect-src 'none'; ...`), `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and the same envelope as `/asset/*`. The preview entry follows `od.preview.entry` with `preview/index.html` + `index.html` fallbacks; the example endpoint matches against folder name / basename / declared title in `od.useCase.exampleOutputs[]`. (`apps/daemon/src/server.ts:servePluginSandboxedHtml`.)
- [x] Preview path traversal / symlink / size guards — the helper rejects `..` segments, refuses to follow symlinks via `lstat`, and caps payloads at 5 MiB.

Validation

- [ ] Browser test: a malicious-fixture preview cannot fetch `/api/*` (CSP `connect-src 'none'`).
- [ ] e2e: install local plugin → marketplace → detail preview → "Use" → Home or ChatComposer prefilled → run produces design.

### Phase 2C — Advanced CLI: files write/upload/delete/diff, project import, run logs (2–3 d)

Deliverables

- [ ] `od files write/upload/delete/diff`.
- [ ] `od project delete/import`, `od run list/logs --since`.
- [ ] `od conversation list/new/info` (basic).

Validation

- [ ] Extend the §12.5 walk-through: `od project import` an external folder → `od plugin apply` → `od plugin replay <runId>` reruns on top.

### Phase 3 — Federated marketplaces + tiered trust + bundle plugins (3–5 d)

Deliverables

- [x] `od marketplace add/list/info/refresh/remove/trust` — Phase 3 entry slice.
- [x] `GET / POST /api/marketplaces`, `POST /api/marketplaces/:id/trust`, `GET /api/marketplaces/:id/plugins`.
- [x] `od plugin install <name>` resolves through configured marketplaces (`resolvePluginInMarketplaces` + `POST /api/plugins/install` bare-name detection). Marketplace trust does NOT auto-propagate — see spec §9.
- [ ] Trust UI on `PluginDetailView` (capability checklist + Grant action).
- [ ] Apply pipeline gates by `trust` + `capabilities_granted` (already partly in Phase 2A; this phase wires UI + marketplace).
- [ ] Bundle plugin installer (multiple skills + DS + craft → registry under namespaced ids).
- [ ] `od plugin doctor <id>` runs full validation including bundle expansion.

Validation

- [ ] e2e: install plugin from a local mock `marketplace.json`, rotate ref, uninstall.
- [ ] e2e: restricted plugin cannot start MCP server until Grant clicked; check `applied_plugin_snapshots.capabilities_granted` updates.

### Phase 4 — Atoms exposure, publish-back, AG-UI adapter, full CLI parity (1–2 wk; splittable)

Deliverables

- [x] `docs/atoms.md`; `GET /api/atoms` returns implemented + reserved (with `(planned)` marker). Source of truth: `apps/daemon/src/plugins/atoms.ts`.
- [x] `od plugin export <projectId> --as od|claude-plugin|agent-skill` — `apps/daemon/src/plugins/export.ts` + `POST /api/applied-plugins/export`.
- [x] `od plugin run <id> --input k=v --follow` (apply + run start wrapper) — landed in §3.B3 (Phase 2A). Full ND-JSON streaming via `od run watch` is also shipped (Phase 1 follow-up §3.F1).
- [x] `od plugin scaffold` interactive starter — `apps/daemon/src/plugins/scaffold.ts`.
- [x] `od plugin publish --to anthropics-skills|awesome-agent-skills|clawhub|skills-sh` (PR template launcher) — `apps/daemon/src/plugins/publish.ts`.
- [x] CLI parity remainder: `od skills/design-systems/craft/atoms list/show`, `od status`, `od version`, `od marketplace search`, `od doctor`, `od config get/set/list/unset`.
- [x] Optional `plugins/_official/atoms/<atom>/SKILL.md` extraction (spec §23.3.2 patch 2) — entry slice ships four atom SKILL.md fragments + the bundled boot walker; the system.ts → SKILL.md prompt-composer rewiring stays open.
- [x] `@open-design/agui-adapter` package; `GET /api/runs/:runId/agui` SSE endpoint emits AG-UI canonical events.
- [x] Plugin manifest upgrade: `od.genui.surfaces[].component` (capability gate `genui:custom-component`) — schema accepts the field; doctor flags missing-capability + path-traversal; web sandbox loader stays scheduled.

Validation

- [ ] **e2e-9 UI ↔ CLI parity**: pick 5 desktop UI workflows; replay each through `od …` only; produced artifacts byte-for-byte equal.
- [ ] AG-UI smoke: a CopilotKit React client subscribes to `/api/runs/:runId/agui` and renders surfaces unmodified. This is an external-interop smoke, not a blocker for OD-native web/desktop rendering.

### Phase 5 — Cloud deployment (parallel; can start after Phase 1.5)

Deliverables

- [x] `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` Dockerfile per spec §15.1 (`deploy/Dockerfile`; entry-slice base is `node:24-alpine` with `NODE_IMAGE` build-arg override → `node:24-bookworm-slim`; bundled atom plugins ship inside the image).
- [x] Release automation pushes `:<version>` / `:latest`; tag pushes publish matching images — `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`.
- [x] `tools/pack/docker-compose.yml`, `tools/pack/helm/` — chart templates (Deployment / Service / Secret / ConfigMap / PVCs / Ingress / NOTES) shipped, per-cloud `values-<cloud>.yaml` overrides shipped (AWS / GCP / Azure / Aliyun / Tencent / Huawei / self-hosted).
- [x] Bound-API-token guard: daemon refuses to bind `OD_BIND_HOST=<non-loopback>` without `OD_API_TOKEN`; bearer middleware on `/api/*` skipped only on loopback peers and on the open probes (`/api/health`, `/api/version`, `/api/daemon/status`).
- [x] `ProjectStorage` adapter substrate — `LocalProjectStorage` (v1 default) wired + tested; `S3ProjectStorage` interface-locked stub; `resolveProjectStorage` reads `OD_PROJECT_STORAGE`. AWS SDK wiring stays as the next Phase 5 PR.
- [x] `DaemonDb` adapter substrate — `resolveDaemonDbConfig` reads `OD_DAEMON_DB` + `OD_PG_*`; the SQLite path is the only reachable backend until the postgres adapter lands.
- [x] **Snapshot retention enforcement job (PB2).** Landed early (§3.A5): periodic worker (`OD_SNAPSHOT_GC_INTERVAL_MS`, default 6 h) deletes expired rows. Referenced-row TTL via `OD_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` stays opt-in. CLI escape hatch: `od plugin snapshots prune --before <ts>`.

Validation

- [ ] `docker run` smoke: image starts, web UI renders, `od plugin install` works inside container.
- [ ] Multi-cloud smoke: deploy compose to AWS Fargate, GCP Cloud Run, Azure Container Apps; produce a fixed plugin's artifact byte-for-byte equal across clouds.
- [ ] Pluggable storage smoke: same plugin alternated between local-disk + SQLite and S3 + Postgres; artifacts identical.

### Phase 6 / 7 / 8 — Post-v1 native scenario coverage (per spec §21.4)

These are tracked but **not part of v1 sign-off**. Listed here so spec patches that promote `(planned)` atoms have a place to update.

- [x] **Phase 6 — figma-migration native**: implement `figma-extract` + `token-map`; ship official `figma-migration` plugin. **All atom impls + asset pass landed (plan §3.M3 / §3.N4 / §3.O2 / §3.P1 / §3.P2 / §3.Q2): `figma-extract` walks the Figma REST API into `<cwd>/figma/{tree,tokens,meta}.json` AND honours `offlineAssets:false` to download per-leaf-node assets via `GET /v1/images` (50-id chunks, per-id failure isolation, configurable size cap, `assets/<id>.<ext>` layout). `token-map` crosswalks any source bag against the active design system. Bundled scenario plugin `od-figma-migration` ships the canonical pipeline.**
- [x] **Phase 7 — code-migration native** (§20.3 §21.3.2): `code-import`, `design-extract`, `rewrite-plan`, `patch-edit`, `diff-review`, `build-test`. **All six atom impls landed (plan §3.N1 / §3.N2 / §3.O2 / §3.O3 / §3.O4 / §3.O5). Bundled scenario plugin `od-code-migration` ships the canonical pipeline (`code-import` → `design-extract` + `token-map` → `rewrite-plan` → `patch-edit ↔ build-test` devloop → `diff-review` → `handoff`). Live HTTP wiring for the per-stage runner keeps to scheduled.**
- [x] **Phase 8 — production code delivery native**: repo-aware multi-file patch orchestration; native review-and-apply surface; promote `handoffKind: 'deployable-app'` from reservation to implementation. **End-to-end wiring landed (plan §3.N3 / §3.O4 / §3.O5 / §3.P3 / §3.Q1 / §3.R1): `patch-edit` enforces shell-tier safety + writes per-step receipts; `diff-review` emits review/{diff.patch,summary.md,decision.json,meta.json}; the daemon auto-derives a `__auto_diff_review_<stageId>` choice surface for every diff-review stage; the web composer's `GenUISurfaceRenderer` renders the diff-review surface natively (Accept all / Reject all / Partial… per-file checklist) plus a generic single-enum-property choice fallback; `POST /api/runs/:runId/genui/:surfaceId/respond` now bridges the diff-review choice surface response into `runDiffReview()` so the user's decision lands on `review/decision.json` immediately. `recordHandoff()` enforces append-only export/deploy targets; `isDeployableAppEligible()` centralises the §11.5.1 promotion rule. `ArtifactManifest` carries the full reserved provenance surface.**

## 7. Spec decisions (locked)

These were originally spec §18 open questions; they are now resolved and propagated into both this plan and `docs/plugins-spec.md` proper. Future spec patches that revisit them must update both files in the same PR.

- **PB1. Lift `## Active plugin` block into `packages/contracts/src/prompts/plugin-block.ts` in Phase 2A** (was Phase 4). **Decision: accepted as proposed.** Both `composeSystemPrompt()` implementations (daemon + contracts) import the same renderer. Spec §11.8 patched to drop the "Phase 4 lifts the block" bullet and the CI byte-equality cross-check fixture; spec §18 patched to mark the open question resolved. Plan §6 Phase 2A gains the deliverable; Phase 4 loses it.
- **PB2. `AppliedPluginSnapshot` unreferenced-row TTL.** **Decision: accepted with one modification** to preserve spec §8.2.1's reproducibility-first stance. Final shape:
  - `applied_plugin_snapshots.expires_at INTEGER` column lands in Phase 1 (NULL allowed).
  - Snapshots referenced by any `runs.applied_plugin_snapshot_id` / `conversations.applied_plugin_snapshot_id` / `projects.applied_plugin_snapshot_id` keep `expires_at = NULL` (pinned forever; reproducibility unchanged).
  - Unreferenced snapshots receive `expires_at = applied_at + OD_SNAPSHOT_UNREFERENCED_TTL_DAYS` (default **30 d**, set to `0` to disable). This is the apply-then-cancel garbage-growth defense.
  - The "expire even referenced" knob `OD_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` is **operator-opt-in only**, default unset; when set, a referenced row may expire if `applied_at` is older than the window AND the referencing row is itself terminal (run finished, conversation archived, project deleted).
  - Both env vars live in `apps/daemon/src/app-config.ts` (per F6 pattern). Phase 1 ships the column + config wiring; Phase 5 ships the periodic enforcement job.
  - Spec §11.4 patched to add the `expires_at` column; spec §18 patched to mark the open question resolved.

## 8. Definition of done (the hard sign-off bar for v1)

v1 ships when **all** of the following pass on a clean Linux CI container without electron. Each row links to the daemon / e2e test path that asserts it.

- [x] **e2e-1 cold install** — `od plugin install ./fixtures/sample-plugin` →
  - daemon-managed plugin storage contains the sample plugin. This plan MUST
    NOT define daemon data paths; read root `AGENTS.md` → **Daemon data
    directory contract** before documenting storage.
  - `installed_plugins` has one row with `trust='restricted'`, `source_kind='local'`.
  - Test path: `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-e2e-fixture.test.ts`
- [x] **e2e-2 pure apply** — two consecutive applies share `manifestSourceDigest`; the project cwd byte size is unchanged; `applied_plugin_snapshots` is not written by `applyPlugin()` itself (the resolver is the writer).
  - Test path: `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-dod-e2e.test.ts` (`e2e-2 pure apply across runs`).
- [x] **e2e-3 headless run (full §8 contract).** Install → project create → run start → status → snapshot fetch all walked at the HTTP layer; the run's first SSE event is `pipeline_stage_started` (asserted via the live SSE stream) and the snapshot id is pinned through every step. `firePipelineForRun()` runs synchronously inside `POST /api/runs` before `design.runs.start()` schedules the agent.
  - Test path: `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-headless-run.test.ts` (both `walks install → project create → run start → status with snapshot pinned` and `first SSE event on a plugin run with od.pipeline is pipeline_stage_started`).
- [x] **e2e-4 replay invariance** — after a same-id plugin upgrade, `renderPluginBlock(snapshot)` returns the byte-equal prompt block; the live applyPlugin against the upgraded plugin produces a different `manifestSourceDigest`.
  - Test path: `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-dod-e2e.test.ts` (`e2e-4 replay invariance`).
- [x] **e2e-5 GenUI cross-conversation** — second conversation in the same project does not broadcast a fresh `genui_surface_request`; it emits `genui_surface_response { respondedBy: 'cache' }` instead.
  - Test path: `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-pipeline-runner.test.ts` (`reuses a project-tier surface answer across conversations`).
- [x] **e2e-6 connector trust gate** — `resolvePluginSnapshot` rejects with HTTP 409 / exit 66 / `capabilities-required` when the snapshot is restricted and `connector:<id>` is missing. Independently, `checkConnectorAccess` rejects the same call so a leaked tool token cannot bypass §5.3.
  - Test path: `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-dod-e2e.test.ts` (`e2e-6 connector trust gate`) + `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-tool-token-gate.test.ts`.
- [x] **e2e-7 api-fallback rejection** — every `/api/proxy/*` entry returns `409 PLUGIN_REQUIRES_DAEMON` when a body smuggles `pluginId` or `appliedPluginSnapshotId`.
  - Test path: `apps/daemon/tests/proxy-routes.test.ts` (`API fallback rejects plugin runs`).
- [x] **e2e-8 apply purity regression** — 100 applies grow the snapshot count by 100, leave the project cwd byte size unchanged, and emit no `.mcp.json`.
  - Test path: `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-dod-e2e.test.ts` (`e2e-8 apply purity regression`).

Plus repo-wide gates

- [x] `pnpm guard` clean.
- [x] `pnpm typecheck` clean.
- [x] `pnpm --filter @open-design/contracts test` clean.
- [x] `pnpm --filter @open-design/plugin-runtime test` clean.
- [x] `pnpm --filter @open-design/daemon test` — all 56 `plugins-*.test.ts` (391 tests) green. Three unrelated pre-existing failures remain (`finalize-design.test.ts` resolveCurrentArtifact path normalization, `chat-route.test.ts` stalled-json-stream timeout, `connection-test.test.ts` hard-cancel timeout). They were inherited from PR #832 and the chat/connection timeout test refactors and do not block the plugin loop; tracked separately.
- [x] `pnpm --filter @open-design/web test` clean.

## 9. Status snapshot (the always-live cell)

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Current phase | Phase 2A + 1 + 1.5 + 2B + 2C entry slice + 3 (full) + 4 (full incl. OD_BUNDLED_ATOM_PROMPTS default ON) + 5 (full incl. live S3 impl; postgres adapter still stubbed) + 6 (full incl. asset rasterisation) + 7 (all six atom impls) + 8 (full incl. GenUI \u2192 decision bridge) + scenarios bundle + bundled-scenario fallback resolver |
| Next planned PR | (a) Phase 2C — `od files write/upload/delete/diff` + `od project import` + `od conversation new`. (b) Phase 3 — Trust UI on `PluginDetailView` + bundle plugin installer. (c) Phase 4 e2e-9 — UI ↔ CLI parity walkthrough (5 workflows). (d) postgres adapter wiring inside the DaemonDb resolver. (e) Scenario registry convergence so Home chips, plugin filters, composer tools, and `@search` project from the same manifest/scenario taxonomy. |
| Open spec push-backs | none — PB1 / PB2 resolved (see §7) |
| Last sync against `docs/plugins-spec.md` | 2026-05-13 (clarified default/no-plugin behavior, `od-default` routing, daemon system-prompt layering, plugin-assembled pipeline stages, OD-native controlled GenUI rendering, AG-UI adapter as interoperability only, and the current Home rail vs PluginsHome facet convergence gap) |

Update this table on every plugin-system PR merge. When the value of "Current phase" advances, also flip the matching deliverables in §6 and the modules in §3.
