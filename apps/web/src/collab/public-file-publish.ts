/**
 * Whether the public single-file "Publish" entry point may be rendered.
 *
 * The rule is A WORKSPACE, not a TEAM workspace.
 *
 * This gate was briefly `workspaceContextHasTeamIdentity`, on the premise that a
 * public link is a resource-hub snapshot keyed by `teamId` and a personal
 * session therefore had nothing to publish under. That premise no longer holds:
 * B stopped refusing a personal workspace on its control-key auth path and now
 * mints a principal whose `teamId` IS the workspace id — a partition of one —
 * while its access check only ever compares that id against the resource's own.
 * A personal workspace addresses its own resource plane exactly as well as a
 * team does.
 *
 * What still fails, and therefore still gates, is a session with NO workspace at
 * all: signed out, or a context read that came back empty. Such a caller has no
 * id to publish under and no member id to own the resource with, and the daemon
 * answers it 409 `WORKSPACE_IDENTITY_REQUIRED`.
 *
 * This must stay the same predicate the daemon applies (`publicFilePrincipal` in
 * apps/daemon/src/routes/collab-sync.ts) — rendering a button where the daemon
 * returns 409 is the exact failure this pair exists to prevent. Both are
 * deliberately narrow: team PROJECT SHARING still requires a real team, because
 * a shared project needs teammates to share it with.
