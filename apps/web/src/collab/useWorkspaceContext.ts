 * about the other direction: a read issued for identity A resolves later, and by
 * then the caller may be identity B. Committing that late answer restores A's
 * data under B — the exact staleness the identity keys exist to prevent,

/**
 * Return the billing summary PROJECTED onto the workspace `context` names.
 *
 * `WorkspaceBillingSummary` is an ACCOUNT read: the contract pins its
 * `workspaceId` to null, and the daemon answers every `?workspaceId=` with the
 * same unscoped `vela billing summary`. Its `membershipTier` therefore says
 * what the ACCOUNT subscribes to, never what THIS workspace subscribes to — an
 * account holding a personal Plus reports `plus` while the user stands in a
 * brand-new, unpaid team workspace. Handing that field to a workspace surface
 * produces a nameplate that cannot change when the workspace changes, because
 * it was never about the workspace: the 专业版 Plus badge on a 免费 workspace,
 * beside a wallet figure that was correct precisely because money already
 * routes through `workspaceBillingBalanceUsd`.
 *
 * Plan and money are partitioned on the same key — `workspaceId` +
 * `workspaceMemberId`:
 *
 *  • personal workspace — the account IS the scope, so the summary passes
 *    through untouched. (A team-namespaced tier is deliberately kept here:
 *    `hasTeamPlan` offers the team surfaces to a personal workspace that holds
 *    a team plan.)
 *  • team workspace — the plan comes from the context-authorized snapshot.
 *    Without one, the account tier may stand in ONLY when it is itself
 *    team-namespaced (`isTeamPlanTier`), because a personal tier
 *    (`free`/`plus`/`pro`/`max`) describes the account's own subscription and
 *    cannot name a team workspace's plan. Anything else becomes `''` — the
 *    contract's "this source does not know" — so `resolvePlanTier` falls
 *    through to the workspace-scoped `context.planId` / `context.billingState`
 *    instead of answering a workspace question with an account tier.
 *
 * That fallback is load-bearing, not laxness: `workspaceSnapshot` is an
 * additive capability, and B omits `planId`/`billingState` from a non-owner's
 * context, so for a paying MEMBER on an older daemon/CLI a team-namespaced
 * account tier is the only surviving evidence that their team is paid. Dropping
 * it flashed the free-tier upsell at Team Plus members (飞书 P0, covered by
 * `tests/components/App.amr-plan-tier.test.tsx`).
 *
 * Money fields are left alone: they are already documented as account metadata
 * and every workspace surface reads them through `workspaceBillingBalanceUsd`.

 *     N consumers failing on the same shared read used to arm N timers whose
 *     N events each fanned out to N listeners; one schedule dispatches one
 *     retry event per cycle and the listeners' coalesced reads share one
