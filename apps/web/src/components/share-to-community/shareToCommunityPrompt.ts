// Trigger prompt for the post-completion "Share to Open Design" submission
// action. Mirrors the constraint surface of
// `home-hero/plugin-authoring.ts`'s `PLUGIN_AUTHORING_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`
// (no chained shell suggestions, no jq, point user at the plugin-folder
// card buttons after the validate/install step) — but starts from
// "introspect the project the user just finished" instead of from a
// goal string the user typed.
//
// The bundled scenario at `plugins/_official/scenarios/od-share-to-community/`
// owns the full playbook. This prompt is the kickoff message that lands in
// the conversation when the user clicks the button.
