/**
 * Tool-loop guard — detects an agent stuck repeating failing tool calls and
 * lets the run loop intervene before it grinds through dozens of identical
 * attempts.
 *
 * Motivating failure (the reason this exists): an agent was asked to move a
 * button into a titlebar element it believed was called `titlebar-left`. The
 * real class was `tb-left`. It wrote a shell verification that asserted
 * `titlebar-left` exists, the assertion failed, it concluded the edit hadn't
 * landed, re-read, and retried the SAME wrong assumption — 80+ tool calls,
 * ~19 of them errors, all looping on one invented identifier. Nothing in the
 * autonomous agent-CLI path noticed or stepped in; the daemon faithfully
 * streamed every attempt. (The BYOK proxy path already bounds its tool loop at
 * MAX_BYOK_TOOL_LOOPS; the autonomous chat agents had no equivalent.)
 *
 * This guard observes the normalized `tool_use` / `tool_result` events that
 * EVERY agent stream emits (Claude stream-json, Codex/OpenCode json-event,
 * Copilot, ACP, …), so a single run-scoped instance covers all of them. It is
 * pure and synchronous: feed it events, it returns a verdict the moment a loop
 * signature crosses a threshold. Two independent triggers:
 *
 *   1. CONSECUTIVE failures — N tool_results in a row are errors with no
 *      successful tool call between them. Catches "everything it tries fails"
 *      even when the agent keeps varying the command. Reset to zero on any
 *      successful tool_result, because a success is real progress.
 *
 *   2. REPEATED failure — the SAME (tool, action) signature errors K times.
 *      Catches fixation: re-running the identical failing Edit/Bash over and
 *      over (the titlebar-left case). A read-only success (Read/Glob/LS/Grep,
 *      TodoWrite, …) does NOT clear this tally: a stuck agent often re-reads the
 *      file and retries the same wrong assumption, so resetting on those reads
 *      would let `fail -> read(ok) -> same fail -> read(ok) -> …` loop forever
 *      (exactly the "re-read, retry the same wrong assumption" shape from the
 *      motivating report). The tally clears only on real PROGRESS: a successful
 *      mutating call (Edit/Write, or a state-changing shell command like
 *      `sed -i` / `pnpm install` / `git commit`), or the failing action itself
 *      finally succeeding. K is set high enough that a couple of legitimate
 *      retries of the same command (fix, re-run, fix, re-run) never trip it.
 *
 * Two escalation tiers per trigger:
 *   - WARN  — emit a one-shot heads-up event so the UI/CLI surfaces "this run
 *             may be stuck" while it is still cheap to stop. Never destructive.
 *   - HALT  — at a hard ceiling, terminate the child so the worst case is
 *             bounded instead of open-ended. Opt-in: the daemon defaults to
 *             warn (heads-up only); operators enable the hard stop via
 *             OD_TOOL_LOOP_GUARD=halt.
 *
 * Latching: WARN fires at most once; after it, continued failures can still
 * escalate to HALT (also once). HALT supersedes WARN if the first counted
 * failure already crosses the ceiling. Once halted, further observations are
 * inert — the run is being torn down.
