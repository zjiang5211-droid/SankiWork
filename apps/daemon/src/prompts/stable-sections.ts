/**
 * Attribution for stable-prefix drift.
 *
 * A resumed agent session holds the stable instruction prefix (daemon prompt +
 * tool contract + client system prompt). When any byte of it changes between
 * turns we must re-send the whole block, which also invalidates the upstream
 * prompt cache for everything downstream of it — including the conversation
 * history. `stable_prompt_cache_miss_reason='stable-prompt-changed'` records
 * THAT this happened; this module records WHICH named input caused it.
 *
 * Attribution is computed over the composer's INPUTS rather than by slicing the
 * composed prompt on its `---` separators. The question a drift event has to
 * answer is "what caused the prefix to move", and the cause is always an input;
 * splitting the output would report which bytes differ but still leave the
 * mapping back to a cause to a human diffing Langfuse traces by hand — which is
 * the manual step this exists to remove.
 *
 * INVARIANT: the sha256 over the whole composed block (`stablePromptHash`) is
 * the only source of truth for cache hit/miss. Section hashes are attribution
 * metadata and must never gate a re-send decision — a section-map bug must be
 * able to mislabel a drift event but never to suppress or fabricate one.
 */

/**
 * Every named input that feeds the stable prefix, grouped into the section it
 * is attributed to. Keys are `composeSystemPrompt` argument names plus the two
 * inputs the caller merges in (`runtimeToolPrompt`, `clientSystemPrompt`).
 *
 * Adding an input to the stable prefix without adding it here does not corrupt
 * the drift signal: the overall hash still moves and the turn is reported as
 * `unattributed`, which is the alarm that this table has fallen behind.
