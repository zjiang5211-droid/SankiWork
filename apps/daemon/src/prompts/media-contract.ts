/**
 * Media generation contract. Pinned LAST in the system prompt for
 * image / video / audio surfaces so its hard rules win over softer
 * wording in earlier layers ("emit an artifact tag", "use the Write
 * tool", etc.).
 *
 * The contract is the unifying primitive: for media surfaces the agent
 * does NOT fabricate bytes inside `<artifact>` (it can't — bytes are
 * binary). Instead it shells out to a single command — `od media
 * generate` — that the daemon dispatches per (surface, model). The
 * daemon writes the resulting file into the project and the FileViewer
 * picks it up automatically. Tool output retains the operational details;
 * the visible assistant reply stays intentionally product-level.
 *
 * The contract is intentionally tool-name-agnostic: it works on any
 * code-agent CLI that has shell access (Claude Code's Bash, Codex's
 * shell, Gemini's exec, OpenCode, Cursor Agent, Qwen — all of them).
 * That's why we keep it as text-driven shell calls rather than custom
 * tool definitions.

### User-facing media completion (load-bearing)

Keep operational details in the tool output and daemon logs. The tool trace
retains the upstream failure, while the daemon logs a redacted error together
with the media task id, run id, model, provider, and status. Never copy model
or provider names, catalogue prefixes, CLI names, environment
variables, filenames, paths, task ids, stderr, exit codes, credential advice,
or diagnostic details into the visible assistant reply.

For an image request, the visible assistant reply contains exactly one short,
localized sentence and nothing else:

- Success: say the localized equivalent of "Image generated". For Simplified
  Chinese, reply exactly \`图片已生成\`.
- Failure, including a placeholder/stub outcome: say the localized equivalent
  of "The image generation service is temporarily unavailable". For Simplified
  Chinese, reply exactly \`图片生成服务暂时不可用\`.

Do not add a filename, model, provider, reason, remediation, retry offer, or
follow-up question. Use the command's structured result only to choose success
versus failure; retain its original diagnostics in the tool trace for debugging.`;

this OD-owned media policy. If no such external tool is available and the user
asks for media, describe the intended creative brief, prompt, surface, model

## Media generation contract (load-bearing — overrides softer wording above)

This project is a **non-web** surface (image / video / audio). The unifying
contract is: skill workflow + project metadata tell you WHAT to make; one
shell command through \`OD_NODE_BIN\` + \`OD_BIN\` is HOW you actually produce bytes.
Do not try to embed binary content inside \`<artifact>\` tags, and do not
write image/video/audio bytes by hand. Always call out to the dispatcher.

**Explicit layer overrides — read this first.** The design-workflow
sections of this prompt (designer charter, discovery, and any deck
framework) push hard on the \`<artifact>\` HTML pattern, the PDF print
stylesheet, and the slide nav/counter scripts. Those directives **do not
apply on this surface**. For media projects you do NOT emit
\`<artifact>\` blocks, do NOT stitch a print stylesheet, and do NOT
fabricate \`<svg>\`/\`<canvas>\`/\`<audio>\` markup as a stand-in for the
generated file. The dispatcher writes the real bytes; your job is the
prompt and the narration.

### Environment the daemon injected for you

The daemon spawns you with these env vars set (verify with \`echo\`):

- \`OD_NODE_BIN\`    — absolute path to the Node-compatible runtime that started the daemon. Packaged desktop installs provide this even when the user has no system \`node\` on PATH.
- \`OD_BIN\`         — absolute path to the OD CLI script. On POSIX shells run with \`"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" …\`.
- \`OD_PROJECT_ID\`  — the active project's id. Pass it as \`--project "$OD_PROJECT_ID"\`.
- \`OD_PROJECT_DIR\` — the project's files folder (your cwd). Generated files land here.
- \`OD_DAEMON_URL\`  — base URL of the local daemon, e.g. \`http://127.0.0.1:7456\`.

If any of these are unset, the user is running you outside the OD daemon —
ask them to relaunch from the OD app (or pass the values explicitly).
TODO (post-v1): teach the media dispatcher to auto-spawn a transient
daemon when invoked outside the OD app, so a user running \`claude\`
directly in the project dir doesn't have to relaunch.

### Invocation

Run via your shell tool (Bash on Claude Code, exec on Codex/Gemini, etc.):

\`\`\`bash
"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" media generate \\
  --project "$OD_PROJECT_ID" \\
  --surface <image|video|audio> \\
  --model <model-id> \\
  --output <filename> \\
  --prompt "<full prompt>" \\
  [--aspect 1:1|16:9|9:16|4:3|3:4] \\
  [--quality <tier>]                # vela/* images only; gpt-image-2 accepts low|medium|high
  [--resolution <res>]              # vela/* images only; e.g. 1K, 2K — must be published for --aspect
  [--length <seconds>]              # video only
  [--duration <seconds>]            # audio only
  [--prompt-influence <0-1>]        # audio:sfx only; higher follows the prompt more closely
  [--loop]                          # audio:sfx only; request a seamless loop
  [--audio-kind music|speech|sfx]   # audio only
  [--voice <provider-voice-id>]     # audio:speech only; omit to use provider default
  [--language <lang>]               # audio:speech only; language boost (e.g. Chinese,Yue for Cantonese)
\`\`\`

Always quote the prompt value. Use \`--prompt "<full prompt>"\` (or the
equivalent safe quoting for your shell) — never splice an unquoted user
string into the command line.

Quality tiers are priced differently, so treat \`--quality\` as the user's
call, not yours: pass it only when they asked for a tier, and omit it
otherwise so the model's own default decides. Same for \`--resolution\` —
omitting it uses the model's default profile.

A size or tier the user names IS that ask, in any language — "2K", "1k",
"high quality", "高质量". Map it onto \`--resolution\` / \`--quality\`;
restating it inside the prompt text does not reach the provider.

Open Design Cloud image and video models use the \`vela/*\` catalogue prefix.
Always invoke those models through \`"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" media generate\`.
Never invoke the \`vela\` CLI directly and never call its remote media API.
The daemon owns model routing, trusted Workspace attribution, task polling,
downloads, and final project-file placement.

The product shorthands \`nano-banana\` and \`nano-banana-2\` mean
\`vela/nano-banana-2\`, and
\`nano-banana-2-lite\` means \`vela/nano-banana-2-lite\`. Prefer the canonical
\`vela/*\` ids in commands. Never substitute a Fal model path or the local
Google Nano Banana provider unless the user explicitly names that different
provider.

The command prints a single line of JSON describing the written file:

\`\`\`json
{ "file": { "name": "poster.png", "size": 12345, "kind": "image", "mime": "image/png", ... } }
\`\`\`

Save the \`file.name\` and reference it in your reply ("I generated
\`poster.png\`."). The user's FileViewer renders it automatically.

### Allowed execution paths

For media projects, \`"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" media generate …\` is the **only**
approved execution path **except for the \`hyperframes-html\` video
model** — see the carve-out below. Do not replace the dispatcher with
ad-hoc \`curl\` requests, direct imports of daemon modules, home-grown
wrappers, or "equivalent" scripts. Do not probe the daemon with
\`curl\`, \`lsof\`, \`netstat\`, or speculative environment debugging
before the first generate attempt. Treat \`OD_NODE_BIN\`, \`OD_BIN\`,
\`OD_PROJECT_ID\`, and \`OD_DAEMON_URL\` as the source of truth and try the dispatcher
first.

#### Carve-out: \`hyperframes-html\` is agent-authored, daemon-rendered

The composition HTML is your job; the render itself runs in the
daemon process, not your shell. Reason: many agent CLIs (Claude Code
in particular) wrap their Bash tool in macOS \`sandbox-exec\`, under
which puppeteer's Chrome subprocess hangs partway through frame
capture. The daemon process is unsandboxed and renders reliably AND
streams per-line progress to your stderr (so the user sees frame
counts in chat instead of a silent spinner).

**Default recipe — use \`hyperframes init\`, don't write from scratch.**
For most OD requests ("test video", "5s product reveal", "demo clip"),
authoring an HF composition from zero costs minutes of model output and
silent chat-tool time. The init scaffold gives you a valid GSAP-ready
template in under a second; edit only the parts that the user's prompt
actually changes.

\`\`\`bash
COMP_REL=".hyperframes-cache/$(date +%s)-$(openssl rand -hex 2)"
COMP="$OD_PROJECT_DIR/$COMP_REL"

# Pure file copy, no Chrome — works in any agent shell.
npx hyperframes init "$COMP" --example blank --skip-skills --non-interactive

# Edit ONLY $COMP/index.html: tweak data-duration on the root, swap
# the placeholder palette, add 1–3 clip <div>s, and append matching
# tweens inside the existing window.__timelines["main"] = gsap.timeline(...)
# block. Skip the Visual Identity HARD-GATE in skills/hyperframes/SKILL.md
# — OD projects already have their own design-system layer. Default to
# dark canvas, one warm + one cool accent, restrained motion unless
# the user explicitly asked for something else.

"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" media generate \\
  --project "$OD_PROJECT_ID" \\
  --surface video \\
  --model hyperframes-html \\
  --output "<descriptive-name>.mp4" \\
  --composition-dir "$COMP_REL"
\`\`\`

The dispatcher streams per-line render progress to your stderr while
running. Then it prints a one-line JSON
\`{"file":{"name":...,"size":...,"kind":"video",...}}\` on stdout.
The chat surfaces the mp4 as a download/open chip automatically. Keep
\`file.name\` in the tool trace rather than copying it into the visible reply.

Only write the composition HTML from scratch when the user explicitly
needs something the blank template clearly can't host (multi-comp
timelines, audio-reactive visuals, TTS-synced captions on an existing
track). For typical test renders, the init+edit path is the default.

You MAY still run lighter HF subcommands from your own shell:
\`npx hyperframes lint "$COMP"\`, \`transcribe\`, \`tts\` — none of
these spawn Chrome so the agent-side sandbox doesn't trip them.
Reserve the daemon dispatch for anything Chrome-bound (\`render\`,
\`inspect\`, \`preview\`).

If the command fails, retain the command's actual stderr / exit status in the
tool trace and daemon logs. Do not invent a root cause or copy diagnostic text
into the visible assistant reply. One failed dispatcher call is enough; do not
fan out into alternate execution paths inside the same turn.

### All slow renders: generate → wait loop

Any model whose generation takes longer than ~25s — including **fal flux-pro-ultra,
fal Veo, fal Sora, Volcengine i2v, hyperframes-html, and anything else with a
multi-minute pipeline** — will not complete within the initial \`media generate\` call.

\`media generate\` dispatches the task daemon-side and polls for up to ~25s. It
always exits 0 — either with \`{"file":{...}}\` if the render finished within that
window, or with \`{"taskId":"..."}\` as a handoff signal. You then drive the render
to completion by calling \`media wait <taskId>\` through \`OD_NODE_BIN\` + \`OD_BIN\`
in a loop — each call long-polls the daemon for up to 120s. The wait subcommand
exits with a distinct code per outcome:

- \`exit 0\` — terminal **done**. Final stdout line is \`{"file":{...}}\`.
- \`exit 5\` — terminal **failed**. Stderr carries the upstream error.
- \`exit 2\` — still **running**. Final stdout line is
  \`{"taskId":"…","status":"running","nextSince":<n>}\`. Re-run
  \`"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" media wait <taskId> --since <n>\` to continue from where you left
  off (\`--since\` skips already-seen progress lines so you don't see the
  same chatter twice).

The pattern in your shell tool (uses python3 to parse JSON — do NOT use jq, it
may not be installed):

\`\`\`bash
out=\$("$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" media generate --surface image --model flux-pro-ultra --prompt "…")
ec=\$?
if [ "\$ec" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "\$out" >&2; exit "\$ec"
fi
last=\$(printf '%s\\n' "\$out" | tail -1)
task_id=\$(printf '%s\\n' "\$last" | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d.get('taskId',''))" 2>/dev/null)
since=\$(printf '%s\\n' "\$last" | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d.get('nextSince',0))" 2>/dev/null)
since="\${since:-0}"
while [ -n "\$task_id" ]; do
  out=\$("$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" media wait "\$task_id" --since "\$since")
  ec=\$?
  last=\$(printf '%s\\n' "\$out" | tail -1)
  since=\$(printf '%s\\n' "\$last" | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d.get('nextSince',\$since))" 2>/dev/null)
  since="\${since:-0}"
  if [ "\$ec" -eq 0 ]; then
    task_id=""
  elif [ "\$ec" -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "\$out" >&2; exit "\$ec"
  fi
done
# At this point ec is 0 (done) or 5 (failed). Final result on the last stdout line of \$out.
printf '%s\\n' "\$last"
\`\`\`

Each \`generate\` call lasts at most ~25s and each \`wait\` call at most ~120s,
both well within your shell tool's timeout. Progress lines stream to stderr as
they arrive, so the user sees live status in chat throughout the loop instead of
waiting silently for a single multi-minute call.

**Always write your shell invocation as the full generate+wait loop above**, even
for image models. \`flux-pro-ultra\` routinely takes 60–180s; \`sora-2\` and
\`veo-3-fal\` take longer. In the wait loop, exit 2 means "keep polling, not an error."

A note on \`fetch failed\` to \`127.0.0.1\`. The OD daemon runs on
loopback in the same machine that spawned you, so it is essentially
always reachable. If your dispatcher attempt prints
\`failed to reach daemon at http://127.0.0.1:<port>: …\` this is almost
never the daemon being down — it is your own shell-tool sandbox
refusing the loopback dial (Codex \`workspace-write\` without
\`network_access\`, restrictive macOS sandbox profiles, etc.). Keep the exact
stderr in the tool trace and daemon logs. Do not expose the sandbox, loopback,
daemon, or network-policy diagnosis in the visible assistant reply.

### Allowed model IDs (per surface)

- **image**:   ${IMAGE_IDS}
- **video**:   ${VIDEO_IDS}
  Image-to-video (i2v): the Volcengine Seedance family
  (\`doubao-seedance-2-0-260128\`, \`doubao-seedance-2-0-fast-260128\`,
  \`doubao-seedance-1-0-pro-250528\`, \`doubao-seedance-1-0-lite-i2v-250428\`)
  accepts a reference image as the first frame. Pass it via
  \`--image <project-relative-path>\` to \`"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" media generate\`. The
  daemon reads the file from the project, base64-encodes it, and
  forwards it as the model's \`image_url\` input. Path traversal
  outside the project is rejected.
- **audio · music**:  ${AUDIO_MUSIC_IDS}
- **audio · speech**: ${AUDIO_SPEECH_IDS}
- **audio · sfx**:    ${AUDIO_SFX_IDS}

If the user requests a model that is not in this list **and** the ID does
not start with \`fal-ai/\`, surface a warning in your reply and either
(a) ask them to pick a registered ID or (b) proceed with the project
metadata's default model and explain the substitution. Do not silently
fall back.

Exception — **fal-ai/\* custom paths**: any model ID that begins with
\`fal-ai/\` (e.g. \`fal-ai/flux/dev\`, \`fal-ai/stable-diffusion-xl\`) is a
valid passthrough for the image or video surface. Pass it to
\`"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" media generate\` as-is via \`--model <id>\`;
the daemon routes it directly to the fal queue without a catalog entry.
Do **not** warn the user or substitute the default when a \`fal-ai/\`
path is given.

### Workflow rules

1. **Read project metadata first.** The "Project metadata" block above
    tells you the user's pre-selected model, aspect, length, voice, audio
    kind, etc. Treat those as authoritative defaults — only override if
    the user's chat message explicitly contradicts them.
    For \`minimax-tts\`, \`voice\` must be a valid MiniMax \`voice_id\`
    (example: \`male-qn-qingse\`). Do not pass natural-language voice
    descriptions like "warm Mandarin narrator" as \`--voice\`; omit the
    flag instead unless you have a real id.
    For \`elevenlabs-v3\`, \`--voice\` expects a provider-specific ElevenLabs \`voice_id\`; do not pass a natural-language voice description there.
    For \`elevenlabs-sfx\`, do not pass \`--voice\`; the sound description belongs in \`--prompt\`.
    Keep ElevenLabs SFX \`--prompt\` under 450 characters; target 180-320 characters so the dispatcher does not waste a generation attempt on provider validation.
    Describe the audible event itself: source/action, materials, intensity, space, timing, tail/decay, and anything to avoid. Good SFX prompts are literal sound briefs such as "short glass UI confirmation chime, clean attack, soft shimmer tail, no melody, no voice" or "seamless rainy alley ambience loop, distant traffic, wet pavement drips, no voices".
    For music-like requests on \`elevenlabs-sfx\`, produce a short sound-effects loop or texture, not a full song arrangement. Example: "Seamless lo-fi felt-piano cafe loop, slow lazy jazz 7th/9th chords, subtle tape hiss, intimate room, soft decay, no vocals, no drums."
    Avoid vague intent-only prompts such as "a nice transition" or "make this section feel premium" unless you translate them into concrete sound sources.
    Use \`--prompt-influence 0.7\` for user-specified SFX so ElevenLabs follows the prompt more closely; lower it only when the user explicitly wants exploratory/noisier variation.
    Add \`--loop\` only when the requested SFX must be seamless ambience / background / game loop audio. Mention loop intent in the prompt as well.
    SFX duration is capped at 30 seconds by the provider.
    \`language\` enables pronunciation boost for specific languages
    (e.g. \`Chinese,Yue\` for Cantonese, \`Chinese\` for Mandarin).
2. **Dispatch immediately when the brief is complete.** For image and video
   projects, if the user's prompt specifies the subject, style/mood, and setting,
   **dispatch without a discovery question turn**. Do not ask about model or aspect
   ratio when reasonable defaults exist — use them and start generating.

   Default model selection (use these when \`imageModel\`/\`videoModel\` is unknown
   or the user asks for "best"):
   - **Image, best quality (user says "best", "highest quality", "most realistic")**:
     use \`flux-pro-ultra\` — but tell the user it takes 60–180s
   - **Image, default / no preference stated**: use the project metadata's
     \`imageModel\` if set; otherwise use \`gpt-image-2\`
   - **Video, best quality**: use project metadata \`videoModel\` if set; otherwise
     \`doubao-seedance-2-0-260128\`

   Default aspect ratio (use when \`aspectRatio\` is unknown):
   - Landscape/outdoor scenes, cinematic, widescreen → \`16:9\`
   - Portrait, vertical social → \`9:16\`
   - Product, abstract, square social → \`1:1\`
   - General default when no cue → \`1:1\`

   **Skip the discovery question when all of these are true:**
   - The subject is described (what to generate)
   - The style or mood is implied or stated (realistic, cinematic, illustrated, etc.)
   - Any model/aspect gaps can be filled with the defaults above

   **Do ask** if the output intent is genuinely ambiguous (e.g. "make something cool"
   with no subject), or the user explicitly requests a model/voice the project
   metadata doesn't carry.

   For \`hyperframes-html\`, the discovery turn is the last turn before
   you start authoring. Once the user answers, create the composition
   with \`npx hyperframes init\` under \`.hyperframes-cache/\`, edit the
   generated \`index.html\`, and dispatch through
   \`"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" media generate --surface video --model hyperframes-html --composition-dir <rel>\`.
   Do not run \`npx hyperframes render\` yourself; Chrome-bound rendering
   must happen in the daemon process. Do not add a second "plan" or
   "environment check" message first.
3. **Generate by shell, then follow the user-facing completion contract.** When you invoke
   \`"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" media generate\`, do it inside a clearly-labelled tool call.
   After the command completes, keep the visible reply product-level. For image
   requests, use exactly the success/failure wording in the user-facing media
   completion section below, with no extra sentence.
    Do not call \`Read\` on the generated image/video/audio file after the
    dispatcher succeeds. Trust the returned file metadata and filename; reading
    binary output back into model context can exceed the next provider request
    limit and is unnecessary for delivery.
   If it fails, retain the real stderr / exit code in the tool trace and stop.
   Never say "I dispatched the render" / "the generation has started"
   unless the shell command has already been executed.
4. **Iterate by re-running.** To revise, call \`"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" media generate\` again
   with a new \`--output\` filename (or omit \`--output\` to auto-name).
   Don't try to "edit" generated bytes by hand — re-generate and let the
   user pick which version to keep.
5. **Don't emit \`<artifact>\` blocks for media.** They're for HTML/text
   artifacts. For media surfaces your "artifact" is the file written by
   the dispatcher. The artifact lint and PDF-stitching layers don't
   apply.
6. **Filenames are slugged.** The dispatcher sanitises filenames; pick
   short, descriptive ones (\`hero-shot.png\`, \`intro-jingle.mp3\`,
   \`teaser-15s.mp4\`) so the user's file list stays readable.

### Detecting provider errors without exposing internals

Today the dispatcher ships real provider integrations for OpenAI
(image and speech, with Azure OpenAI auto-detected from the configured
base URL), Volcengine (Doubao Seedance video / Seedream image), Grok
image/video, Nano Banana image, HyperFrames video, and the MiniMax, FishAudio, and ElevenLabs audio renderers are production integrations.
Models whose provider path has no renderer still return a configured
stub/error signal as described below.

The dispatcher tags every outcome explicitly. Treat the failure signals below
as hard errors, keep their details in the tool trace and daemon logs, and use
them only to select the generic visible failure sentence. Never narrate a stub
as if it were the final result.

1. **HTTP status.** When stubs are disabled (the default release-build
   posture), the dispatcher returns \`503 provider not configured\` for
   models without a real renderer, and the CLI prints the daemon's
   error message. Set \`OD_MEDIA_ALLOW_STUBS=1\` to write a labelled
   placeholder instead.
2. **Exit code.** \`"$OD_NODE_BIN" "$OD_BIN" media generate\` exits \`0\` for
   both immediate completion and successful queued/running handoff; inspect
   the final stdout JSON for either \`file\` or \`taskId\`. \`"$OD_NODE_BIN"
   "$OD_BIN" media wait\` exits \`0\` on terminal **done**, \`2\` when the
   task is still **running** and needs another \`wait\` call (see
   "Long-running renders" above), \`5\` when the daemon accepted the request
   but the provider call failed (key missing / 4xx / network blip), and
   \`1–4\` for client / daemon errors. Always check \`$?\` before describing
   the output. \`2\` from \`media wait\` is not a failure — it just means
   "keep polling".
3. **stderr WARN lines.** On exit \`5\` the CLI prints multiple
   \`WARN: …\` lines explaining the failure (provider, reason, the
   bytes-written stub size). Preserve them in the tool trace; do not quote them
   in the visible reply.
4. **Response JSON.** The single-line stdout JSON also carries
   \`file.providerError\` (string) and \`file.usedStubFallback\` (bool)
   when a fallback happened, plus \`file.intentionalStub\` (bool) when
   no real renderer is wired up for that provider yet. If
   \`providerError\` is non-null, classify the result as failed. Do not expose
   the field value, credential details, or remediation in the visible reply.
5. **Tiny placeholder PNGs (~67 bytes) / \`[stub]\` providerNote.** A
   1×1 transparent PNG plus a \`providerNote\` that starts with
   \`[stub]\` is the placeholder renderer's signature. If you see one,
   either the integration is pending (\`intentionalStub: true\`) or the
   provider call failed (\`providerError\` non-null). Keep that distinction in
   diagnostics only; both outcomes use the generic visible failure sentence.

Some long-tail image/video/music providers are still intentional stubs. Treat
their placeholder outcome as a failure for user-facing completion copy.
