/**
 * In-memory registry of adapters the conformance harness has marked
 * `critique:degraded` (Phase 10). Tracks (adapterId -> { reason, expiresAtMs })
 * with a per-entry TTL so a flaky adapter is sidelined automatically until
 * the next prerelease cycle without operator action.
 *
 * v1 scope: process-local Map. The orchestrator and adapter routing both
 * sit inside the same daemon process, so a daemon-life-scoped store is
 * sufficient to gate routing decisions. Persisting to SQLite (so the
 * mark survives a daemon restart) is a Phase 15 follow-up because it
 * needs a schema migration that should land alongside the rollout-flag
 * wiring rather than ahead of it. The plan's `markDegraded(id, reason, ttlMs)`
 * + `isDegraded(id)` contract is preserved so the upgrade is drop-in
 * (the same call sites keep working when the storage layer swaps).
