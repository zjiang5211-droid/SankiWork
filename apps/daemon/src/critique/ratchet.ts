/**
 * M-phase rollout ratchet (Phase 16).
 *
 * Phase 15 shipped the rollout resolver. Phase 12 shipped the
 * observability surface that lets us measure conformance. This module
 * is the bridge: it takes a window of daily conformance numbers and
 * answers "given the current rollout phase, should we promote, hold,
 * or demote?". The answer is a recommendation, not an action. An
 * operator-driven follow-up wires the actual `OD_CRITIQUE_ROLLOUT_PHASE`
 * flip into a deploy pipeline; this module's job is to make the
 * recommendation explicit and auditable so the operator does not have
 * to read a Grafana panel to know what to do.
 *
 * The function is pure: it takes data in and returns a decision out,
 * with no I/O. That lets the same evaluator drive both the prerelease
 * recommendation log line and the `GET /api/critique/conformance`
 * endpoint, and lets vitest pin every cell of the decision matrix
 * without standing up a daemon.
 *
 * Spec source: `specs/current/critique-theater.md` § Rollout, which
 * states the M3 threshold as "14 consecutive days at >= 90% adapter
 * conformance across the fleet". The clean-parse threshold (>= 95%
 * runs free of parser_warning) is a sibling gate; both must hold.
