 * Synthetic adapter that emits the canonical happy-path transcript
 * (`happy-3-rounds.txt`). Used by the Phase 10 conformance harness so
 * the parser + orchestrator can be exercised end-to-end against a
 * deterministic input that has no network or model dependency.
 *
 * The harness uses this fixture two ways:
 *   1. In-process via `syntheticGoodTranscript()`, which returns the raw
 *      transcript string. Tests wrap it in an `AsyncIterable<string>`
 *      and feed `parseCritiqueStream`.
 *   2. As a child-process stub via the sibling `synthetic-good.cli.ts`
 *      script, which writes the same transcript to stdout. The CLI form
 *      lets the existing daemon CLI-spawn primitive treat this fake
 *      adapter identically to a real one (the path the plan calls out
 *      for the prerelease matrix).
