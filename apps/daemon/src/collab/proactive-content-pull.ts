// Hub push-channel consumer for 'project-content-changed' (recvqmKQRiIlYf):
// a teammate published a new version of a shared project, so THIS daemon
// pulls the content proactively — no open tab required — instead of leaving
// freshness to the member web's ~5s status polling. That polling stays
// running untouched as the fallback (and as the ONLY mechanism while the hub
// channel is down); everything here degrades to it: a guard skip, a failed
// pull, or a revoked project simply leaves freshness to the poll loop.
//
// Guard boundary (all fail CLOSED — an uncertain answer skips the pull):
//   - An existing local binding must be a team binding. A newly-shared project
//     with no local binding may bootstrap only from an explicitly scoped hub
//     event. That exact Workspace is resolved through authoritative membership
//     rather than the daemon's mutable global active Workspace. This
//     closes the first-publication gap: the catalog can expose the card before
//     the member has ever opened/materialized it, and waiting for an open tab
//     leaves its files/details absent for tens of seconds.
//   - The pull NEVER runs when this daemon's member owns the project. The
//     owner's local copy is the single writer (see useProjectCollab.ts's
//     member auto-pull gate, which holds the same rule on the web side);
//     pulling over it could clobber unpublished edits. The owner's daemon
//     receives its own publish echo over the SSE channel, so this guard is
//     load-bearing, not defensive.
//   - Event workspace, local binding workspace, and the exact resolved
//     identity must all agree; a mismatch means the event belongs to a scope
//     this daemon must not address with that principal.
//
// Dedup model: a per-project cursor records the version the last successful
// pull materialized, so repeated/out-of-order events for an already-landed
// head are no-ops; an event racing an in-flight pull waits it out and re-runs
// AT MOST once when the cursor is still behind (a newer head arrived while
// pulling). The cursor only advances on a successful pull — failures keep it
// behind so the same-version retry stays possible.
