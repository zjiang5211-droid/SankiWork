# Open Design MCP installer wrapper.
#
# This file is served verbatim by the static landing page at:
#   https://open-design.ai/install.sh
#
# It intentionally delegates to the product-owned installer:
#   od mcp install <agent>
#
# Keeping the real installer in the daemon avoids duplicating the per-agent
# config planner in a hosted shell script. This wrapper exists so curl|sh no
# longer receives the landing-page HTML fallback, and so users get a clear
# error when the shell resolves /usr/bin/od or another non-Open-Design binary.

Open Design MCP installer

Usage:
  curl -fsSL https://open-design.ai/install.sh | sh -s <agent> [options]

This is a thin hosted wrapper around:
  od mcp install <agent> [options]

Examples:
  curl -fsSL https://open-design.ai/install.sh | sh -s codex --print
  curl -fsSL https://open-design.ai/install.sh | sh -s cursor --write-config

Options are forwarded to `od mcp install`. For the complete option list:
  od mcp install --help
EOF
}

if [ "${1:-}" = "--help" ] || [ "${1:-}" = "-h" ]; then
  usage
  exit 0
fi

if [ "$#" -eq 0 ]; then
  printf '%s\n\n' "Open Design install.sh: missing required <agent> argument." >&2
  usage >&2
  exit 2
fi

if ! command -v od >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  cat >&2 <<'EOF'
Open Design install.sh: `od` was not found on PATH.

Install and open the Open Design desktop app, or run the daemon from a source
checkout so the Open Design CLI is available, then re-run this command.
EOF
  exit 1
fi

od_probe="$(od mcp install --open-design-cli-probe 2>/dev/null || true)"
if [ "${od_probe}" != "open-design-cli:mcp-install:v1" ]; then
  od_path="$(command -v od || true)"
  cat >&2 <<EOF
Open Design install.sh: '${od_path}' does not look like the Open Design CLI.

On macOS, Linux, and WSL2, /usr/bin/od is the system octal-dump command and can
shadow Open Design's CLI. Put the Open Design CLI earlier on PATH, then re-run
this command.

If you installed the macOS desktop app via the DMG or Homebrew cask, the app
bundle does not add an 'od' shim to your shell PATH. Launch Open Design and use
Settings -> MCP server to copy the client-specific install snippet instead;
that snippet uses absolute paths and avoids the system 'od' collision.
