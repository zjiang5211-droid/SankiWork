// Shared CTA-action shaping for the comparison (/alternatives/*) and agent
// (/agents/*-design/) landing pages.
//
// These pages lead with the desktop download: drop the generic "get started"
// CTA (the /quickstart/ action) and surface only two buttons — Download,
// emphasized as the primary, and Star on GitHub as the secondary. Actions are
// matched by their locale-stable hrefs, so this holds across every translation
// without editing per-locale copy.
//
// The download button always points at the on-site download page
// (DOWNLOAD_HREF), regardless of what the (drifted) per-locale copy had — the
// English base used /download/ while older translated copy linked straight to
// GitHub /releases; both are normalised here to the localized download page.
