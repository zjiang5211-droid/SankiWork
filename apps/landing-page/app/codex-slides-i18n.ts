/*
 * `/codex-slides/` — sister-project landing page copy.
 *
 * Codex Slides (github.com/nexu-io/codex-slides) is the third product in the
 * Product menu next to HTML Anything and HTML Video: an open-source, image-native
 * AI slide studio that runs *inside* Codex. You describe a deck (or point it at a
 * repo / a pile of files), Codex opens the Browser-first studio, and the whole
 * chain stays visible and steerable — research → outline → style → render → edit
 * → present → export PPTX/PDF. It runs on an existing `codex login`, so there is
 * no separate API key, and every project stays on the user's disk.
 *
 * SEO surface: the head terms are "Codex Slides" (brand), "AI slide generator" /
 * "AI presentation maker" (category), and "open source Gamma alternative" (the
 * comparison query the README itself leads with). Long-tail like "AI PPTX export",
 * "slides from a repo", and "Codex plugin" is seeded through the section copy.
 *
 * Structure mirrors `community-i18n.ts`: `en` is the authoritative base, every
 * other locale is a DeepPartial override translated by an Agent and merged over
 * it, so an untranslated string falls back to English instead of breaking the
 * layout. Non-translatable facts (counts, install commands, export formats,
 * image paths) live in the page itself, never duplicated per language.
