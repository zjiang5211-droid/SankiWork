title: 'Why Open Design''s Output Looks Designed — A Developer''s Look Under the Hood'
youtubeId: qXElL9HeNMM
summary: A developer's read of Open Design — why its output looks designed rather than improvised. Covers the deterministic loop (discovery form → direction picker → checklist → self-critique), the clean local architecture, how skill.md front-matter drives the agent, and BYOK through an OpenAI-compatible proxy. Based on Nyndra AI's source-level review.

Most AI design tools improvise from a blank prompt and it shows. This guide is a developer's read of *why* Open Design's output looks designed instead — the deterministic parts of its loop, the clean local architecture, and how the whole thing is wired. It follows the source-level review **Nyndra AI** gives in [their video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXElL9HeNMM), rewritten and brought up to date with the current release. Watch the video above, or read on for the written version.

## The idea: you don't ship an agent

Open Design's premise is that the strongest coding agents already live on your laptop, so it doesn't ship one — it **wires the agent you have into a skill-driven design workflow**. A local daemon gives that agent a real project folder with real read/write/bash/web-fetch tools — not a sandboxed toy. It auto-detects your CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Qwen, Copilot — many total), and if you have more than one, you swap the active one with a single click, no config edits.

## Why the output looks designed: the deterministic loop

Nyndra's core observation, after reading the source: **the parts that matter are deterministic, so the model can't freestyle its way to slop.**

1. **Discovery form** — locks your brief (surface, audience, tone, brand) *before* the model improvises anything.
2. **Direction picker** — forces a choice between curated visual schools. No freestyle vibe.
3. **Checklist culture** — preflight against the skill spec, an on-disk project folder, a seed template.
4. **Five-dimensional self-critique** — the agent reviews its own work like a reviewer who doesn't pull punches, before you see it.

The result "looks designed because the agent was told to behave like a senior designer who checks their work."

## How skills drive the agent

Each skill is a folder under the skills directory. The daemon parses the **`skill.md` front matter** — mode, scenario, preview type, design-system requirements, fidelity, animations — and the agent reads that spec before drawing. That's the inversion that makes it work: **the skill drives the agent**, instead of the agent improvising from a blank prompt. Design systems are the same idea for style — each a real `DESIGN.md` (palette, typography, spacing, components) the agent reads before generating, so outputs look like someone studied the brand guidelines.

## BYOK, local-first, Apache-2.0 (the three that matter for running it)

- **BYOK** — bring your own key through an **OpenAI-compatible proxy**: plug in DeepSeek, Grok, OpenRouter, or your own vLLM.
- **Local-first** — your data lives in SQLite on your machine.
- **Apache-2.0** — fork it, deploy it to Vercel, modify it, ship it under your own name, no permission needed.

## Run it (three commands)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nexu-io/open-design.git
cd open-design
corepack enable && pnpm install
pnpm tools-dev run web
```

The daemon boots, scans your path, detects your CLI, and the web layer opens at the local URL it prints (a dynamic port — don't hardcode one). There's also an import endpoint for Claude Design export ZIPs — drop one on the welcome dialog and your agent picks up where the closed tool left off. Prefer no terminal? Grab the desktop app from [open-design.ai/download](https://open-design.ai/download).

## The honest take

Nyndra's verdict: it's the most credible open-source AI design tool right now — clean architecture, active community, real design-system depth. The risk is fragmentation (fast-moving open-source projects either consolidate or spawn stale forks). But as a thing you can clone and run today, it's compelling.

## Tips

- **Trust the deterministic loop** — fill the discovery form and pick a direction; that's what prevents slop.
- **Read a `skill.md`** to understand what drives the agent, and write your own for a custom surface.
- **BYOK via an OpenAI-compatible proxy** (OpenRouter/DeepSeek/vLLM) for cost or self-hosting.
- **Import a Claude Design ZIP** to continue existing work locally.
- **It's Apache-2.0 and local** — fork, self-host, and keep your data on your machine.

## FAQ

**Why does its output look better than typical AI UI?**
Because the loop is deterministic where it counts (discovery form, direction picker, checklist, self-critique) and skills/design-systems give the agent a spec to follow instead of a blank prompt.

**What drives the agent?**
A skill's `skill.md` front matter (mode, scenario, fidelity, etc.) and the chosen `DESIGN.md` — the agent reads both before generating.

**Can I use non-Anthropic models?**
Yes — BYOK through an OpenAI-compatible proxy (DeepSeek, Grok, OpenRouter, or your own vLLM), plus the auto-detected local CLIs.

**Is it free and open source?**
Yes — Apache-2.0, local-first (SQLite on your machine). Run it for free; you only pay for the model usage of whatever you connect.
