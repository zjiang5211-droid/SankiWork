title: 'Which Coding Agent Should You Run Open Design With?'
youtubeId: 6yyF5kJEO20
summary: A setup guide focused on the one choice that matters most — which coding agent drives Open Design. It supports a broad runtime set (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Qwen, Copilot, Devin, Hermes, Kimi, Pi, Kiro, and more); here's how to pick one, install from source, and build your first design. Based on Tony Xhepa's walkthrough.

Open Design's first real decision isn't what to build — it's **which coding agent drives it**. This guide focuses on that choice: the (long) list of supported agents, how to pick one, and how to set up and build. It follows the walkthrough **Tony Xhepa** gives in [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yyF5kJEO20), rewritten and brought up to date with the current release. Watch the video above, or read on for the written version.

## Why the agent is the important choice

Open Design doesn't ship its own model — it's an open-source, local-first surface that **runs on whatever supported coding agent you already have**. So the agent you pick *is* your design engine: it determines quality, cost, and speed. The runtime list is broad: **Claude Code, Codex, Devin for Terminal, Cursor, OpenCode, Qwen, GitHub Copilot CLI, Hermes, Kimi, Pi, Kiro — and more.** Whatever you're already running, Open Design probably supports it, and if you have none installed, you can configure a BYOK provider instead.

## How to pick one

A quick way to choose:

- **Already paying for a coding CLI?** Use it — Open Design rides on that subscription, so there's no second bill.
- **Want the strongest design output?** Point it at a top model (e.g. Claude Code on a capable model) for the initial build.
- **Want it cheap or free?** OpenCode's available models or another supported free-tier runtime work well; you can also configure Google Gemini or another provider through BYOK.
- **Care about privacy/local?** Any local CLI keeps generation on credentials that never leave your machine.

You're not locked in — swap the active agent later in one click.

## Step 1 — Install from source

Open Design is a Next.js app; the Quick Start is a handful of commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nexu-io/open-design.git
cd open-design
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm tools-dev run web
```

Then open the local URL it prints (a dynamic port — don't hardcode one). One note Tony hits: it wants **Node 24** — on Node 22 you'll see an "unsupported engine" warning, so install Node 24 first. Prefer no terminal? There's a desktop app at [open-design.ai/download](https://open-design.ai/download).

## Step 2 — Configure execution mode (pick your agent)

On first launch you set the **execution mode**. In Tony's recording, the local list included Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, and Pi; he chose OpenCode. Current releases no longer expose Gemini CLI as a direct runtime, so choose another detected CLI or configure Google Gemini through BYOK, then select the model and click **Get started**.

## Step 3 — Build your first design

Create a **Prototype**, name it, pick fidelity (high), and start from a suggested brief (Tony picks a SaaS analytics dashboard). Open Design runs the **discovery questions** (brand context, chart data source, visual direction), you answer, pick a direction, and it builds. The finished artifact has a preview, source-code view, comments, and a **Share** menu — export as PDF, download, standalone HTML, save as template, and more.

## Tips

- **Pick the agent you already pay for** — no second subscription, and it sets your quality/cost.
- **Install Node 24 first** to avoid the unsupported-engine warning.
- **Use `local CLI` mode** so Open Design auto-detects your installed agents.
- **Swap agents anytime** — the choice isn't permanent; change it in one click.
- **No CLI? Use an API key** (Anthropic or OpenAI) instead.

## FAQ

**Which agents does Open Design support?**
Many — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Qwen, GitHub Copilot CLI, Devin, Hermes, Kimi, Pi, Kiro, and more. It auto-detects the supported ones installed on your machine.

**How do I choose one?**
Use the CLI you already pay for; pick a strong model for the initial build and a cheaper one for iteration; or use a free tier / your own API key.

**Why the Node 24 warning?**
Open Design requires Node 24; on Node 22 you'll see an "unsupported engine" warning. Install Node 24 to clear it.

**Is it free and open source?**
Yes — Apache-2.0, local-first. Run it for free; you only pay for the model usage of whichever agent or key you connect.
