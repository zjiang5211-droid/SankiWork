If you build for clients, a closed design tool's weekly cap and single model make it hard to work at scale. This guide is an agency/freelancer playbook for Open Design: why it's **commercially safe**, how to **manage spend by switching models**, and how to ship client work fast. It follows the walkthrough **Dylan Michael** gives in [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VleXU_AmRfg), rewritten and brought up to date with the current release. Watch the video above, or read on for the written version.

## Why it works for client work

Open Design is an open-source, local-first design platform that runs **on top of the coding agent you already use** — and for agencies, three properties matter most:

- **Apache-2.0 = commercially safe.** You can use it on client projects, sell what you build, and never ask permission or pay royalties — unlike some restrictively-licensed clones.
- **Local-first = you own everything.** Projects live on your machine, so client work isn't sitting in someone else's cloud.
- **Any model = managed spend.** Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, or free models — you're not forced to burn a premium model's credits on every task.

Dylan's blunt framing: a closed tool can cost $20–$200/month and *still* rate-limit you to a couple of designs a week, which is unworkable when you're serving clients. Open Design removes the cap and the lock-in.

## Step 1 — Install and pick your engine

Ask your editor's agent to clone and set it up (paste the repo URL and let Claude Code / Codex run it), or grab the desktop app from [open-design.ai/download](https://open-design.ai/download). On first launch it shows every supported runtime already installed locally (Codex, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, …) — click **rescan** if you just added one, or configure a BYOK provider. Pick the CLI and model, and save.

## Step 2 — Build the client deliverable

Create a project (Dylan builds a premium sales-analytics dashboard), choose **high fidelity**, and prompt. Open Design asks **clarifying questions** (screens, surface, accent color, what the heatmap/leaderboard shows) and shows **the cost of each task** as it goes — useful when you're budgeting a client job. Pick a color scheme and it builds a polished one-shot result, then you refine in plain language ("add a premium refresh animation, switch to glassmorphism, tighten the spacing").

## Step 3 — The cost move: switch models mid-project

This is the agency economics. Dylan's rule: **build the structure with a strong model** (it's best at interpreting the design), then **switch to a cheaper model for the details and edits** — in the recording, he changes the CLI in the bottom-left from Claude Code to Codex/Gemini and saves. The direct Gemini runtime is now retired; current releases use Codex/OpenCode here, or Google Gemini configured through BYOK. For truly low cost, point it at **OpenRouter** and use budget or free models (a DeepSeek-class model is a fraction of the price at ~90–95% of the quality for iteration). You decide where each dollar goes instead of letting one premium model run wild on your credits.

You can also add a media provider key (e.g. OpenAI) and drop **generated images** right into the deliverable, then **deploy to Vercel** in one click for client review.

## Tips

- **Lean on the Apache-2.0 license** — ship client work without permission or royalties.
- **Build with a strong model, iterate with a cheap one** — the biggest cost lever.
- **Watch the per-task cost** shown in the UI to budget a client job.
- **Use OpenRouter for budget/free models** on the tedious edits.
- **Deploy to Vercel** for fast client review links.

## FAQ

**Can I use Open Design for paid client work?**
Yes — it's Apache-2.0, so it's commercially safe to use, sell, and self-host with no royalties or permission.

**How do I keep costs down across a project?**
Build the structure on a strong model, then switch to a cheaper model (or free models via OpenRouter) for iteration; the UI even shows each task's cost.

**Does it have the closed tool's weekly cap?**
No — generation runs on the agent/keys you connect, so you manage spend instead of hitting a fixed weekly limit.

**Is it free and open source?**
Yes — Apache-2.0. Run it locally for free; you only pay for the model/media usage of whatever you connect.
