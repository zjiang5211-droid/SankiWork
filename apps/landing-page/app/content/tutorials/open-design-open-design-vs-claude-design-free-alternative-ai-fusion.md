title: 'The Four Libraries Behind Open Design — Skills, Systems, Templates, and Craft'
youtubeId: G3I1E12I8Y0
summary: A tour of the four content libraries that make Open Design's output good — composable skills, portable design systems, ready-to-fork templates, and the under-discussed "craft" layer (brand-agnostic rendering principles auto-enforced by a linter). Based on AI Fusion's walkthrough.

Why does Open Design's output look better than a typical AI design tool's? Because of four content libraries working together — and one of them, **craft**, rarely gets discussed. This guide tours all four. It follows the walkthrough **AI Fusion** gives in [their video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3I1E12I8Y0), rewritten and brought up to date with the current release. Watch the video above, or read on for the written version.

## What is Open Design?

Open Design is the open-source, local-first alternative to a closed cloud design tool. It doesn't ship its own AI agent — it **detects the coding agents you already have** (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Qwen, and more), or you bring your own API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure, Google Gemini, even a local model via Ollama). The architecture is clean: a front-end talking to a local daemon, everything saved to a local SQLite database so your projects are always there when you come back.

## The four libraries

### 1. Skills — the "how to build it" layer

Skills are organized by mode, scenario, and platform. Each is literally **just a folder with one skill file** — drop it in, restart the daemon, and it appears in the picker. Beyond the obvious (SaaS landing, dashboard, docs), there are striking ones: a Swiss-international deck (16-column grid, single accent, locked layout variations), a magazine-editorial deck (ink-and-e-paper aesthetic), and creative video skills like glitch title cards and cursor light-trail intros.

### 2. Design systems — the "how it looks" layer

Each design system is a **single markdown file** with the full token spec: colors, typography, spacing, components, motion. Apple's premium white space, Airbnb's warm coral photography-driven UI, Airtable's structured-data look, Ant Design for data-dense apps — a large, portable library that keeps every artifact visually consistent.

### 3. Templates — the "start from something" layer

Ready-to-fork complete artifact bundles with sample data already in them. Fork the folder, swap in your data, ship. Think a magazine-poster template (oversized serif headline, two-column body) or an audio-jingle template that routes music to Suno/Udio and speech to ElevenLabs/MiniMax.

### 4. Craft — the "why it's high quality" layer (the under-discussed one)

This is the part most reviews skip. **Craft** is a set of brand-agnostic rendering principles that skills can declare they need, and the agent loads the relevant ones into its system prompt automatically:

- An **accessibility baseline** that goes beyond the legal minimum.
- **Animation discipline** — when motion earns its place, and its constraints.
- **Color rules**, **editorial typography hierarchy** for long-form, and **form-validation rules**.

Crucially, **some are auto-enforced by a linter**, so failing them is treated as a regression, not a style preference. That's a big reason the output quality is higher than you'd expect from an AI design tool — the standards are enforced, not suggested.

## Install and try it

Download the installer from [open-design.ai/download](https://open-design.ai/download) (macOS/Windows) and launch — clean interface, chat area on top, ready-to-use community options by category (prototype, live artifact, slides, image, video, hyperframes, audio). AI Fusion adds a Gemini API key, tests the connection, then forks a community **live-artifact** (a social-media matrix tracker dashboard). It lays out the full plan, then builds a responsive result you can check on tablet/mobile, retheme, view as code, and download as HTML.

## Tips

- **Pick a skill for structure and a design system for style** — that pairing is most of the quality.
- **Fork a template** when you want to start from something complete rather than a blank prompt.
- **Know that craft is enforced** — the accessibility/animation/typography baselines are linted, not optional.
- **Browse [open-design.ai/plugins](https://open-design.ai/plugins/)** to see the current skills and systems.
- **Any model works** — the libraries carry the quality; connect whatever you have.

## FAQ

**What actually makes the output good?**
Four libraries: skills (structure), design systems (style), templates (starting points), and craft (rendering principles, some auto-enforced by a linter).

**What is the "craft" layer?**
Brand-agnostic rendering rules (accessibility, animation discipline, color, typography, form validation) that skills opt into and the agent loads automatically — several are linted, so violations are regressions.

**Are skills and systems easy to add?**
Yes — skills are folders with a skill file; design systems are single markdown files. Drop them in and they're picked up.

**Is it free and open source?**
Yes — Apache-2.0, local-first. Run it for free; you only pay for the model/media usage of whatever you connect.
