# Builds the @open-design/daemon workspace package — produces $out/bin/od.
#
# Implementation note on dream2nix:
#   The flake takes `dream2nix` as an input (per the project's Nix
#   contract) but the build itself uses stdenv.mkDerivation. dream2nix's
#   nodejs builders consume npm's package-lock.json — they have no
#   first-class pnpm-lock.yaml + workspace builder yet. When upstream
#   ships one, swap this file for a thin dream2nix module — the inputs
#   are already wired.
#
# pnpm version note:
#   `package.json` declares `engines.pnpm` and pnpm enforces it on
#   `pnpm install` (regardless of `engine-strict`). The nixpkgs
#   default `pnpm` is generally incompatible — older than the
#   floor or newer than the ceiling depending on which nixpkgs
#   the consumer follows. The flake overrides `pkgs.pnpm_10` to
#   the exact tarball pinned by `packageManager` (see flake.nix
#   for the override + hash bump). This derivation uses
#   `pnpm_10` for both phases: in `nativeBuildInputs` so the
#   install-phase `pnpmConfigHook` resolves it from PATH, and
#   `pnpm = pnpm_10` to `fetchPnpmDeps` to override its
#   `pkgs.pnpm` default.
#
# Workspace siblings the daemon depends on are built in dependency order
# before the daemon itself; tsc emits each package's dist/, which is what
# the daemon resolves at runtime via pnpm's symlinked node_modules.

      # Build better-sqlite3's native binding from source.

      # Why from source on Node 24:
      #   better-sqlite3 (even 12.9.0, latest as of 2026-05) only
      #   publishes prebuilds up to node-v131 (Node 22). No v137
      #   (Node 24) prebuild exists. `prebuild-install` would itself
      #   fail the GitHub fetch and fall through to a compile, so we
      #   skip the download attempt entirely and compile.
      #
      # Why not `pnpm rebuild`:
      #   In pnpm 10, `onlyBuiltDependencies` interacts with the
      #   "approve-builds" consent gate; `pnpm rebuild <pkg>` silently
      #   no-ops in some configurations. Invoke node-gyp directly to
      #   sidestep all of that.
      #
      # Env vars:
      #   * npm_config_nodedir → use the headers shipped with the
      #     nixpkgs nodejs we're already building against, so node-gyp
      #     doesn't try to fetch them from nodejs.org/dist (no network
      #     in the build sandbox).
      #   * npm_config_build_from_source → tell better-sqlite3's
      #     prebuild-install fallback chain to skip the CDN download
      #     and compile.
      #
      # node-gyp lookup:
      #   nixpkgs nodejs ships node-gyp bundled inside npm at
      #   ${nodejs}/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/node-gyp-bin. Putting
      #   that on PATH gives us a `node-gyp` shim without depending
      #   on pnpm-exec resolving from inside better-sqlite3's tree
      #   (better-sqlite3 doesn't list node-gyp as a direct dep).
