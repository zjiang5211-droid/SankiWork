# Collab realtime — current implementation and hop 1 design history

Status: implemented on `main`. Owner: workspace-team.

## Implemented state

Collaboration invalidations now travel over two implemented SSE hops:

- **Hop 1 (vela → daemon):** the daemon opens an exact-workspace cloud-hub
  subscription at `/api/v1/collab/events`. It verifies that the `ready` event
  names the requested workspace, uses heartbeats to monitor stream health,
  reconnects after interruptions, and performs source-gap catch-up.
- **Hop 2 (daemon → web):** the daemon publishes thin invalidations at
  `/api/projects/:id/events` and `/api/workspace/events`; web clients re-fetch
  the affected state rather than receiving full resource payloads.
- **Polling floor:** polling remains as a slower recovery floor so missed or
  unavailable push events still converge.

## Historical design context — July 15 proposal

The remainder of this document preserves the original July 15 design snapshot
and rationale. Its proposed endpoint, event catalogue, status statements, and
sequencing are historical context, not the current wire contract.

## Why this exists

Open Design is local-first: **every user runs their own daemon** on their own
machine, and **vela (cloud) is the shared collaboration backend**. Any
cross-user change (user A comments on a shared project; user B should see it)
travels two hops:

```
User A edits
   │  A's web → A's daemon → vela        (write path, unchanged)
   ▼
① vela (cloud) ─────────▶ B's daemon     ← cross-user / cross-machine
   │  today: B's daemon POLLS vela
   ▼
② B's daemon ───────────▶ B's web        ← same machine
   │  today: B's web POLLS B's daemon
```

**Hop ② (daemon→web SSE)** is being implemented separately (branch
`feat/collab-sse`). It removes the same-machine polling flood and is the local
delivery layer. But it does **not** change cross-user latency: hop ② still
depends on hop ① delivering the change to the daemon, and hop ① is **poll-only
today**. Cross-user latency is therefore floored at the daemon's vela-poll
interval (~5s for comments; on-demand for members/context).

**This document specifies hop ①: a push channel from vela to the daemon**, so a
change made by one user reaches other members' daemons in near-real-time,
replacing the daemon's polling of vela.

## Historical implementation snapshot (July 15)

- `apps/daemon/src/collab/collab-cloud-service.ts` runs an internal `setInterval`
  poll (~5s) that calls `client.pullComments(...)`. This is the only self-driven
  daemon poll.
- Members / workspace context / billing are fetched via the vela CLI on demand
  (web-request-driven, with short-lived caches).
- There is **no push/subscribe path between daemon and vela**. The only
  `subscribe` in the collab layer is `collab-publish-watcher`, which watches
  **local disk files** (chokidar), not vela.

So hop ① is genuinely new backend surface.

## Goal

vela exposes a push channel the daemon subscribes to, delivering **thin
invalidation events** ("something of type X changed") for the teams/projects the
subscribing user is a member of. The daemon reacts by re-pulling the affected
resource (it already owns the pull code) and forwarding a hop-② event to its web
client.

Non-goals:
- Not changing the write path (daemon→vela writes stay via the existing CLI/HTTP).
- Not pushing full payloads. Events are thin signals; the daemon re-pulls. This
  keeps payloads tiny, avoids server-side fan-out of large bodies, and makes a
  missed event during a disconnect harmless (a reconnect snapshot covers it).

## Event catalogue (what vela must emit)

Scope: per team (workspace) and per shared project the subscriber can see.

Workspace-scoped:
- `team-projects-changed` — a project was shared / unshared / created / deleted.
- `members-changed` — a member joined / left / changed role.
- `workspace-context-changed` — seat count / entitlement / context changed.
- `billing-changed` — subscription / seat billing changed.

Project-scoped (carry `projectId`):
- `comment-changed` — a comment was added / edited / deleted / resolved.
- `presence-changed` — a member went online / away / offline on this project.
- `project-metadata-changed` — name / settings changed.
- `resource-changed` — published files / resources changed.

Thin event shape (proposed):

```jsonc
{
  "type": "comment-changed",
  "teamId": "team_...",
  "projectId": "proj_...",   // present for project-scoped events
  "at": "2026-07-15T14:30:00.000Z",
  "eventId": "evt_...",       // optional, monotonic per team — enables Last-Event-ID
  "actorId": "user_..."       // optional, lets the daemon suppress echo of its own writes
}
```

No resource body. The daemon maps `type` → re-pull call.

## Transport (vela to choose; SSE recommended)

Options, in preference order:

1. **SSE** — `GET /v1/teams/{teamId}/events` (`text/event-stream`), one-way
   server→daemon, HTTP/1.1-friendly, native auto-reconnect, native
   `Last-Event-ID`. Matches the thin-event model. **Recommended.**
2. **WebSocket** — bidirectional, which we do not need (writes already go via the
   existing path). More infra for no benefit here.
3. **Long-poll** — acceptable fallback if SSE infra is hard; higher latency and
   more request churn.

Recommendation: **SSE per team**, multiplexing all event types over one
connection.

## Subscription model

- The daemon opens **one SSE per authenticated team** (not one per project),
  multiplexing every event type. This keeps the daemon's connection count to
  vela at one-per-team.
- **Auth**: reuse the vela session/token the daemon already holds for CLI calls.
  The endpoint authenticates the subscriber and scopes events to teams/projects
  that subscriber is a member of. The daemon must never receive events for
  projects the user cannot see.
- **Server-side filtering**: vela emits to a subscriber only the events for its
  visible teams/projects.

## Catch-up / reconnect

- On (re)connect the daemon **re-pulls current snapshots** for its active
  resources (comments for open projects, member/context for the workspace). It
  already has this code. So a disconnect gap is closed by the snapshot — **no
  server-side event buffer is required for correctness**.
- `Last-Event-ID` is **optional**: if some resource is too expensive to re-pull
  wholesale, vela may support replay-since-id for that type. Not required for v1.
- Heartbeat: vela should emit a periodic `:ping` comment (~15s) so the daemon can
  detect a dead connection and reconnect.

## Daemon-side changes (our side, once vela ships this)

1. Add a vela-events subscriber that opens the team SSE using the daemon's vela
   session.
2. On each event: re-pull the affected resource, then emit the corresponding
   **hop-② thin event** to the web sinks (workspace sink / project
   `activeProjectEventSinks`).
3. **Keep the existing polls as a fallback floor**: while the vela SSE is
   connected, pause/slow them; while disconnected, resume them. This is the same
   poll-as-floor pattern hop ② uses, and it means a daemon that cannot reach the
   vela SSE (old build, network) degrades to today's behavior with no regression.
4. Suppress echo of the daemon's own writes using `actorId` where useful.

## Scale / open questions for vela backend

- Can vela expose a per-team SSE endpoint authenticated by the existing daemon
  session token?
- What change granularity can vela emit? Does it have a change-feed / can it hook
  the write path to publish these events, or would it need its own internal poll?
- Connection budget: many member daemons subscribe per team simultaneously. Is a
  long-lived SSE per daemon acceptable at vela's scale, or is long-poll / a
  shared fan-out layer preferred?
- Presence specifically: presence is high-churn. Is a coalesced/debounced
  `presence-changed` (e.g. at most one per project per N seconds) acceptable to
  keep event volume down?

## Sequencing

- Hop ② (daemon↔web SSE) ships first, independent of this — it fixes the local
  flood and is the delivery layer this feeds. It is gated on the packaged
  `net.fetch` proxy fix (SSE is buffered by the old undici proxy).
- Hop ① (this doc) turns cross-user collab real-time once vela ships the push
  channel and the daemon subscriber replaces the polls.
