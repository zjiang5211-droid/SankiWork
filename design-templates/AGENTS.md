# design-templates

This directory holds **design templates** — packaged "shapes" the agent
renders into a project artifact (decks, prototypes, image/video/audio
templates, …). Each entry is a folder with a `SKILL.md` (same shape as
functional skills) plus rendering side files (`example.html`,
`assets/`, `references/`, …).

If the entry primarily *does work* on user input — utilities, briefs,
asset packagers, fidelity audits — it belongs under `../skills/`
instead. See `specs/current/skills-and-design-templates.md` for the
full split.

## Daemon plumbing

- Listed under `/api/design-templates`. The shape mirrors `/api/skills`
  (same `SkillSummary`/`SkillDetail` types) so the web client can
  reuse a single `SkillSummary[]` consumer for both surfaces.
- Asset and example routes (`/api/skills/:id/example`,
  `/api/skills/:id/assets/*`) intentionally span both registries — the
  example HTML rewrites to `/api/skills/<id>/...` regardless of which
  root owns the folder, so URLs keep resolving after the split.
- Surfaced in the New-project panel's per-mode "Start from" rail as the
  rendering catalogue; the redesigned home has no top-level Templates tab.

## Adding a design template

1. Create `design-templates/<my-template>/SKILL.md` with `name`,
   `description`, `triggers`, and an explicit `od.mode` (one of
   `prototype`, `deck`, `template`, `image`, `video`, `audio`).
2. Ship a baked `example.html` (and any side files) so the shared example and
   asset routes have preview content to serve.
3. Optionally drop additional baked samples under `examples/<key>.html`
   to surface them as derived `<parent>:<key>` cards.

## Deck preview navigation contract

Any template with `od.mode: deck` must make its baked `example.html`
usable inside the gallery iframe without relying on the host app to add
navigation. Use a shared deck runtime where one is available; otherwise
ship a tiny local runtime with the same minimum behavior.

- **Keyboard:** `ArrowRight` / `ArrowDown` / `PageDown` / `Space` move to
  the next slide; `ArrowLeft` / `ArrowUp` / `PageUp` move to the previous
  slide; `Home` and `End` jump to the first and last slide. Ignore events
  from inputs, selects, textareas, and editable regions.
- **Wheel / trackpad:** accumulated `deltaX + deltaY` past a small threshold
  moves exactly one slide, then resets quickly so a single gesture does not
  overshoot.
- **Touch:** a horizontal swipe of roughly 50px or more, greater than the
  vertical movement, moves previous / next.
- **Dots:** render one clickable button per slide, update the active dot on
  every navigation path, and mark it with `aria-current="true"`.
- **Active slide state:** keep the visible slide marked with
  `.slide.active`; adding `.is-active` as a compatibility alias is fine.
  Open Design's preview bridge reads this state for the host slide counter,
  so it must stay in sync with keyboard, wheel, touch, and dot navigation.
- **Iframe safety:** focus the deck on load / pointer interaction so keyboard
  navigation works after the gallery preview appears. Avoid
  `scrollIntoView()` because it can move the parent page instead of the deck.
- **Fallbacks:** no-script and print output should still expose every slide.
  Hide non-active slides only after the runtime has booted.
