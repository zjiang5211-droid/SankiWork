# open-design-landing-deck

Sister design template to [`open-design-landing`](../open-design-landing/).
Produces a single-file slide deck in the **Atelier Zero** design
language — warm-paper background, italic-serif emphasis, coral
terminating dots, surreal collage plates — paginated as a horizontal
magazine swipe deck (←/→ · wheel · touch · ESC overview), the same
nav model as [`guizang-ppt`](../guizang-ppt/).

> **Read first** — agent contract, schema, and self-check live in
> [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md). This README is the human quick-start.

## 30-second tour

```bash
# 1. Compose the worked example.
npx tsx scripts/compose.ts inputs.example.json example.html

# 2. Open it.
open example.html
```

The deck assumes 16 collage assets at `../open-design-landing/assets/`
(the sister template ships them). Use ←/→ · Space · PageUp/PageDown ·
Home/End to navigate, ESC for the overview grid.

## What you get

- N viewport-sized slides (the worked example has 11) laid out
  horizontally on a `transform: translateX(...)` flex track.
- Per-slide chrome strip (top + bottom): brand mark · deck title ·
  location · live `NN / TT` counter.
- Coral progress bar at the bottom that fills as you advance.
- Dot indicator near the bottom (click to jump).
- ESC overview grid with scaled thumbnails.
- 7 slide kinds: `cover`, `section`, `content`, `stats`, `quote`,
  `cta`, `end`. Mix freely.
- Same 16-slot image library as the landing-page sister template —
  no extra prompting or rendering.

## Authoring a deck

1. Copy `inputs.example.json` to your project as `inputs.json`.
2. Edit `brand` (or copy it from an `inputs.json` for the sister template).
3. Set `deck_title` (the kicker shown in the chrome strip).
4. Build the `slides` array. Each entry is one of seven kinds — see
   [`schema.ts`](./schema.ts) for the full type. A typical pitch:

   ```text
   1.  cover     — title plate
   2.  section   — chapter divider
   3-5. content  — manifesto, capabilities, method
   6.  stats     — the numbers
   7.  section   — chapter divider
   8.  content   — selected work
   9.  quote     — customer testimonial
   10. cta       — primary action
   11. end       — kicker word
   ```

5. Run the composer:

   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/compose.ts inputs.json out/index.html
   ```

## Image strategy

The deck inherits the sister template's 16-slot image library. Set
`inputs.imagery.assets_path` to wherever those PNGs live; the example
uses `'../open-design-landing/assets/'`.

To regenerate or stub:

```bash
# Generate via gpt-image-2 (fal.ai)
FAL_KEY=fal-... npx tsx ../open-design-landing/scripts/imagegen.ts \
  ../open-design-landing/inputs.example.json \
  --out=../open-design-landing/assets/

# Or paper-textured SVG placeholders
npx tsx ../open-design-landing/scripts/placeholder.ts ../open-design-landing/assets/
```

## Migrating from `editorial-collage-deck`

This design template replaces the older `editorial-collage-deck` skill. The renames
are mechanical:

| Old | New |
| --- | --- |
| skill folder `editorial-collage-deck/` | `open-design-landing-deck/` |
| shared assets `../editorial-collage/assets/` | `../open-design-landing/assets/` |
| TS type `EditorialCollageDeckInputs` | `OpenDesignLandingDeckInputs` |

The deprecated `EditorialCollageDeckInputs` alias is still re-exported from
[`schema.ts`](./schema.ts) for backwards compatibility. New code should use
`OpenDesignLandingDeckInputs`.
